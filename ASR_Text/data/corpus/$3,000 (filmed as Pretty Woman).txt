FADE IN:
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
It is shortly after midnight on an icy night.
An old yellow Mustang pulls alongside the curb on a sleazy 
section of Hollywood Boulevard. The passenger door opens and 
Vivian steps out. She quickly shuts the door and walks away from 
the car as if it wasn't there. The Mustang drives off. Vivian 
continues strolling down the street, cold white breath floating 
from her bright red lips.
Dressed in a tight purple leather mini-skirt, black stockings 
and a white imitation fur jacket, Vivian is twenty-two years 
old. She has been hooking for over six years. Heavy make-up 
gives her pretty face a dangerous and hard look.
She lights up a cigarette and takes a drag. She moves gracefully 
on spiked heels across the grime-covered sidewalk. She owns this 
section of the boulevard. After six years on the street she has 
seen it all. She has done everything and will do anything. 
Humiliation is for the shy. Fear is for the innocent.
Occasionally a car passes and Vivian's hawk eyes watch it for 
any indication of interest.
She passes a vagrant huddled in a pile of ragged blankets and 
newspapers in a doorway. She barely sees him; he is simply part 
of the scenery.
Across the street a black prostitute strolls by, rubbing her 
shoulders against the cold. At an all-night fast food stand, 
several drug dealers are talking and eating.
Yet, except for the occasional sound of police helicopters in 
the distance, the street is quiet. It is not bustling with 
activity like a TV cop show. It is empty and lonely and cold.
Vivian's ears and cheeks are red from the chill, but her 
cigarette keeps her warm inside. A couple more customers and 
she'll earn enough for the night.
She glances across the street at a bright yellow Winchell's 
doughnut shop. Half a dozen people sit at the dirty white tables 
inside. She sees something that annoys her. She changes course.
Vivian hurries across the street toward the Winchell's. She 
pushes the glass door open and goes inside.
INT. WINCHELL'S - NIGHT
Behind the counter we see two older Vietnamese men making 
doughnuts, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the 
shop.
As Vivian enters, a gangly, ugly young Drug Addict moves toward 
her. His faltering voice and awkward movements indicate that he 
is on the last legs of excessive crack use.
DRUG ADDICT
Hi, V-vvivian.
Vivian doesn't even glance at him.
VIVIAN
Hi.
She moves past him toward the back of the shop. Sitting at a 
table is Kit, a young, dark-haired prostitute, thin and 
unhealthy-looking. She is talking with a black Old Man.
KIT
Vivian.
Vivian looks at her, annoyed.
VIVIAN
Kit, what are you doing?
KIT
Waiting for you. It's fucking cold 
out there.
VIVIAN
It's not going to be any warmer 
tomorrow night.
The Old Man waves at Vivian.
OLD MAN
Hi, Viv.
VIVIAN
(quickly, without looking 
at him)
Hi.
(to Kit)
Let's get working. We've only got a 
couple hours before the street 
clears.
KIT
It's too cold. No one's out.
VIVIAN
They're out.
Kit coughs so loudly and deeply that it's obvious she has 
emphysema.
KIT
Let's get high.
Vivian grabs Kit by the shoulder and drags her toward the door.
VIVIAN
We're going to work. Come on.
2.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT
Vivian and Kit come out of the shop and onto the street. As they 
walk Kit wraps her arms tightly around her body to shield 
herself from the cold. She starts to cough again.
KIT
It's too cold. I'm gonna get sick.
VIVIAN
We've got to work. The rent's 
coming up. I'm not going to lose 
our place.
KIT
We'll make it up tomorrow. Let's 
get high.
VIVIAN
How much have you made tonight?
KIT
(hesitantly)
Twenty.
Vivian is angry.
VIVIAN
One fucking date?
KIT
I haven't felt good.
VIVIAN
I'm going to fucking kick you out 
if you don't start holding up your 
end!
Kit's eyes water and she starts to sniffle.
VIVIAN
Don't cry on me. I'm not your 
mother. You promised to hold up 
your end or I wouldn't have let you 
move in.
Kit wipes her eyes.
KIT
Tomorrow's Friday. We'll make it up 
then. Don't you want to get high?
VIVIAN
I don't want to spend everything 
we've got. The rent's coming.
From Vivian's face we see that she is starting to relent.
VIVIAN
Give me the twenty.
3.
Kit reaches down and pulls out a twenty dollar bill from her 
sock. She hands it to Vivian. Vivian stares at her levelly.
VIVIAN
You're not holding out on me?
KIT
It's all I've done. No one's out.
Kit starts to cough again.
VIVIAN
(softening)
Maybe it is too cold.
They walk down the street toward the fast food stand.
KIT
Are we going to get high?
VIVIAN
Just be quiet for awhile.
Kit knows that means yes. She rubs her shoulders and hurries to 
keep up with Vivian's long strides.
A car approaches slowly and Vivian pauses to watch it. It passes 
without stopping. Vivian continues on.
EXT. FAST FOOD STAND - NIGHT
Vivian and Kit approach a Latino Drug Dealer.
VIVIAN
Where's Carlos?
DRUG DEALER
What you want, girl? I can fix you 
up.
VIVIAN
Where's Carlos?
DRUG DEALER
The cops got him. What you want?
VIVIAN
I only buy from him. When's he 
getting out?
DRUG DEALER
How do I know? You think I'm a 
lawyer? You want some stuff or not?
He holds up a small baggie containing three rocks.
VIVIAN
I don't want any of that yellow 
shit. Don't you have any white?
4.
DRUG DEALER
This is good stuff.
He shakes them from the baggie into his hand.
DRUG DEALER
I'll let you taste it.
He offers it out. Vivian glances around, unsure, looking for 
another dealer.
DRUG DEALER
Taste it.
Kit comes up to Vivian's side.
KIT
Let's just get it.
The drug dealer offers it to Kit.
DRUG DEALER
Taste it, sugar.
Kit takes a rock and tastes it with her tongue.
KIT
(to Vivian)
Let's get it.
Vivian sighs and pulls out a twenty. Before the dealer can grab 
it, she pulls it back.
VIVIAN
Not that one, the big one.
She points at a different rock in the Dealer's hand. The Dealer 
rolls his eyes (the rocks all seem the same size to him) and 
takes the rock from Kit's hand. He hands Vivian the other rock. 
Vivian hands him the twenty.
VIVIAN
When's Carlos getting back?
DRUG DEALER
He's across the street, girl.
He points across the street at another drug dealer who has just 
come around a corner. Vivian sees him. She flips the Dealer off.
VIVIAN
You fucker! This better be good 
stuff.
DRUG DEALER
It's good.
He walks away. Vivian and Kit turn and head back down the 
street.
5.
INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
Vivian and Kit stand at the counter of a liquor store. A small 
Vietnamese Clerk is behind the counter.
VIVIAN
Give me a pipe kit.
The clerk reaches under the counter and pulls out a small baggie 
containing a cheap glass pipe and a bit of steel wool.
CLERK
(in broken English)
You want lighter?
Vivian nods and selects a red Bic from the display. She hands 
the clerk a five-dollar bill and he hands back the change. 
Vivian counts it and then stashes it and the pipe kit away.
VIVIAN
(to Kit)
Come on.
They exit together.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Vivian and Kit walk down the street together, heading for home.
VIVIAN
We should bleach your hair.
KIT
(coughing)
I like my hair.
VIVIAN
You'll make more money if we bleach 
it. If you're going to stick with 
me you're going to have to make 
more money.
KIT
(meekly)
Okay.
Vivian puts an arm around Kit's shoulders.
VIVIAN
It'll be pretty. We'll give it a 
natural curl or something.
Vivian teases Kit's hair with her fingers.
VIVIAN
You'll like it.
KIT
(more hopefully)
Okay.
6.
Vivian hears a car slowing behind them. She glances over her 
shoulder and sees a sleek black Mercedes following them.
VIVIAN
Look at that.
The Mercedes pulls up past them and stops. Vivian and Kit pause.
VIVIAN
(grinning)
There's rent.
Kit isn't happy about the delay, but she waits obediently as 
Vivian walks up to the car and leans over the passenger window.
The window electrically rolls down and Vivian looks inside.
In the driver's seat is Edward Harris, a good looking, well 
groomed man in his late forties. He is wearing an expensive suit 
and tie.
VIVIAN
You want a date?
Edward stares at Vivian coolly, as if still debating. His eyes 
look at her as if studying a label on a bottle of wine. He makes 
a decision.
EDWARD
Yes, hop in.
VIVIAN
How much you want to spend?
Edward smiles, amused for some reason.
EDWARD
What are your rates?
Vivian, influenced by his car and clothes, blurts out a high 
figure.
VIVIAN
A hundred.
EDWARD
For the whole night?
VIVIAN
(quickly)
For an hour.
EDWARD
I'm looking for someone for the 
whole night.
VIVIAN
For what?
7.
EDWARD
Whatever.
VIVIAN
Five hundred.
EDWARD
That seems high.
VIVIAN
Three hundred.
Edward is enjoying this game.
EDWARD
Two fifty.
Vivian eyes Edward. Two fifty is more than enough, but she can't 
help thinking that she could get more from him. She decides not 
to push it.
VIVIAN
Where do you want to go?
EDWARD
I've got a hotel room.
VIVIAN
Okay. Wait a second.
Vivian walks over to Kit's side.
VIVIAN
I'm going to go with him.
KIT
How long?
VIVIAN
I don't know. He said the night. Go 
on home. Here ...
Vivian hands Kit the baggie with the pipe and the rock.
KIT
Will you be home in the morning?
VIVIAN
I don't know.
KIT
What if I'm hungry?
Vivian pulls out a twenty and hands it to Kit.
VIVIAN
Don't spend it all.
Kit nods.
8.
KIT
Maybe he'll give me a ride?
Vivian turns back toward the Mercedes and bends down until she 
can see Edward through the window.
VIVIAN
Can my friend have a ride home?
Edward shakes his head.
EDWARD
I'm not a taxi.
Vivian turns to Kit.
VIVIAN
Go on.
Kit coughs. She's unhappy about going home alone.
KIT
I'll wait up for you awhile. In 
case you get home. We'll get high 
together.
Vivian pats Kit affectionately on the shoulder.
VIVIAN
It's okay, babe. You don't have to 
wait for me. Just save some.
Vivian gets inside the Mercedes. Kit watches as it drives off.
INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT
Vivian sits comfortably in the warm leather seat. She finds the 
ashtray on the dash and lights a cigarette with the car lighter. 
She looks at Edward curiously as he drives.
VIVIAN
Nice car. Yours?
EDWARD
It's rented.
VIVIAN
What's your name?
EDWARD
Edward. What's yours?
VIVIAN
Vivian. What motel are you at?
EDWARD
The Beverly Wilshire.
9.
VIVIAN
That place next to Augie's?
Edward regards her for a moment, amused.
EDWARD
Beverly Hills.
VIVIAN
(oblivious)
Nice place?
Edward smiles to himself.
EDWARD
It's alright.
VIVIAN
You from out of town?
EDWARD
New York.
VIVIAN
I've never been to New York. How is 
it?
EDWARD
It's alright. How do I get back to 
Wilshire?
VIVIAN
Make a left up there. Why are you 
in L.A.?
EDWARD
Business.
VIVIAN
What kind of business?
EDWARD
(glancing sideways)
My, you talk a lot.
Vivian, squelched, takes a drag from her cigarette.
VIVIAN
Just being friendly.
Edward doesn't respond.
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
The Mercedes glides through the streets of Beverly Hills.
10.
INT. MERCEDES - NIGHT
Edward looks over at Vivian, who is sitting silently next to 
him.
EDWARD
My overcoat's in the back seat. Why 
don't you put that on?
VIVIAN
Why?
EDWARD
Let's just say you're a little over-
dressed for this ... motel.
VIVIAN
They don't like hookers?
EDWARD
It's not the kind of place that 
rents rooms by the hour.
VIVIAN
Every place has hookers. They just 
don't like to admit it.
EDWARD
Perhaps so. But if this hotel has 
any hookers they don't look like 
they're ...
VIVIAN
... off the Boulevard?
EDWARD
Exactly.
EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the 
Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Bright flags are illuminated by 
carefully placed spotlights.
The Mercedes has stopped in a valet parking lane. A valet opens 
the passenger door and Vivian, bundled up in Edward's overcoat, 
steps out. Edward hands the keys to another valet.
A doorman opens the huge glass door for Vivian and Edward. They 
step inside.
INT. LOBBY OF THE BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - NIGHT
The lobby is bright and spacious, filled with thick carved wood 
paneling and expensive decorations. Even at this hour there is a 
great deal of activity; men in business suits and women in furs 
and jewels are passing by to their rooms.
Vivian's face tries to conceal the awe that she feels at the 
sight of all this luxury. 
11.
She covers it well, lifting her chin up slightly and stiffening 
her back as she walks at Edward's side.
Edward is perfectly at home. He places one hand on Vivian's 
elbow and guides her through the lobby as gracefully as he 
drives his Mercedes.
They reach the elevators and go inside.
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
The young Elevator Operator is dressed in a clean red uniform 
that seems just a bit too tight. As the elevator doors close he 
nods toward Edward.
OPERATOR
Floor, sir?
EDWARD
Penthouse.
OPERATOR
Yes, sir.
The tone of the Operator's voice indicates that Edward will not 
have to tell him again. He will remember Edward. There is only 
one penthouse.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Edward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway 
leading to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors. Edward 
pulls his key and unlocks the door. With a gentle push the doors 
slide open in unison.
Edward gestures to Vivian to go inside. She does. Edward closes 
the doors behind her.
INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling 
off the top of the building. In front of her is a sunken living 
room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the 
city below. She is speechless.
Edward is quite at home. He closes the door and walks past her, 
down the steps to the living room. The living room is filled 
with museum-quality art deco furniture, all rose and gray and 
lavender. On one of the walls is a relief of stylized Egyptian 
figures. He picks up a phone.
EDWARD
Room service ... I'd like a bottle 
of the house champagne and a bowl 
of chilled strawberries sent to my 
room. Penthouse. Thank you.
Vivian still stands motionless by the front door. Edward looks 
up at her, his trademark half smile drifting to his face.
12.
EDWARD
Nice view?
Vivian says nothing. She makes her way down the steps to the 
living room, her legs a little weak.
EDWARD
I've impressed you?
Vivian looks at Edward, her awe giving way to a cynical sneer.
VIVIAN
No. I come here all the time. As a 
matter of fact, they do rent this 
room by the hour.
Edward laughs. He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans 
back.
EDWARD
Very good.
Vivian paces through the room, still hypnotized by the view, but 
recovering quickly.
VIVIAN
I don't get it. What's a guy like 
you doing cruising Hollywood 
Boulevard?
EDWARD
Why not?
VIVIAN
Hell, you should be able to pick up 
a phone and order a girl from Room 
Service.
(suspiciously)
Unless you're into some weird stuff...
EDWARD
No, not at all. Just the usual 
stuff. I don't have that much 
imagination.
Edward loosens his tie.
EDWARD
To be honest, I wasn't planning on 
having a girl tonight at all. I was 
sightseeing the Chinese Theater 
when I got lost.
VIVIAN
Lost?
EDWARD
I don't know the city very well and 
while I was driving around I 
spotted you.
13.
VIVIAN
And fell in love.
EDWARD
Or a close approximation.
A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the front door.
EDWARD
That should be the champagne.
He starts to sit up. Vivian motions for him to stay put.
VIVIAN
Eh, sit! I'll get it.
Edward sits back down. Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the 
front door. A Waiter comes into the room with a silver cart. On 
it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.
WAITER
Where would you like it?
VIVIAN
Down there, I guess.
The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle 
of the living room.
EDWARD
That'll be fine.
The Waiter heads back up the stairs and pauses near Vivian. 
Vivian stares back at him.
VIVIAN
(annoyed)
What are you looking at?
The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits. Vivian closes 
the door behind him. Vivian marches back down the stairs.
EDWARD
I think he wanted you to tip him.
VIVIAN
For one bottle?
EDWARD
I quite agree.
Edward stands up and crosses to the silver stand. He lifts the 
lid on the bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries. He eats 
one. He twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket and then 
gracefully lifts it out.
VIVIAN
I still don't see why you picked me 
up. Don't you have a girlfriend or 
a wife, or both?
14.
Edward deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop 
of champagne.
EDWARD
Both. I got the house brand. I 
didn't think you'd mind.
VIVIAN
It all tastes the same to me. So 
where's your girlfriend and wife? 
Sleeping together?
Edward pours the champagne into a long-stemmed glass and hands 
it to Vivian.
EDWARD
My wife divorced me and is in 
Europe I believe. My girlfriend is 
in New York. Cheers.
Edward places the champagne bottle back into the bucket. Vivian 
holds the glass awkwardly.
VIVIAN
Aren't you going to have any?
EDWARD
I wish I could. But my liver rotted 
away. I can't have any alcohol.
VIVIAN
You don't have to get me drunk, 
honey.
Vivian takes a sip from the glass.
EDWARD
No. I just like the smell. Fond 
memories.
He eats another strawberry. He glances at Vivian's glass.
EDWARD
How do you like it?
VIVIAN
Not much. I don't really drink. I 
smoke though. I don't guess you do?
EDWARD
No. Not tobacco or otherwise.
VIVIAN
It was the otherwise I wanted.
EDWARD
Try a strawberry. It'll bring out 
the sweetness of the champagne.
15.
Vivian eats a strawberry and then washes it down with the 
champagne.
EDWARD
Better?
VIVIAN
It's okay. Why didn't your 
girlfriend come with you?
Edward's face sours.
EDWARD
I don't know. Just being difficult.
Vivian takes another sip and smiles wickedly.
VIVIAN
She wants a new mink.
Edward isn't sure if he finds that funny.
EDWARD
My but we do like to talk.
Vivian shrugs.
VIVIAN
You want me to shut up, I'll shut 
up. It's your two fifty.
She takes another sip from her glass.
Edward turns from her and walks to the windows. He looks out 
into the city.
Vivian finishes her champagne, goes to his side, and starts to 
rub his shoulders. She leans over and kisses his neck.
Edward takes her chin in his hands and studies her face. He runs 
a finger over her lips until his fingertip is covered in red 
lipstick. He then takes the finger and touches her nose, leaving 
a red dot.
EDWARD
Have some more champagne.
He returns to the tray and pours her another glass. Vivian rubs 
the lipstick from her nose.
VIVIAN
I don't like it much.
EDWARD
A bit more. Here.
He places the glass in her hand and tips it up toward her face. 
She drinks it.
16.
EDWARD
Nothing puts a sparkle in a woman's 
eyes like champagne.
Edward's hand continues to lift the glass until Vivian finishes 
it. She takes a breath
VIVIAN
You should see my eyes when I've 
smoked a piece.
Edward takes the glass from her hand and sets it down.
EDWARD
Five hundred years ago a cocaine-
snorting nation of Indians was 
enslaved by a few dozen drunken 
Spaniards.
VIVIAN
So?
EDWARD
I think it was McLuhan who said 
that alcohol is the drug of 
civilized man.
EDWARD
You like to talk, too.
Edward smiles.
EDWARD
Yes. I guess I do.
Vivian glances around the room.
VIVIAN
So where are we going to screw? Or 
do you just want to talk?
EDWARD
How about the bedroom? You want any 
more champagne?
VIVIAN
No. I don't like to drink too much. 
I get numb.
EDWARD
Alright.
He takes her by the hand and leads her toward the bedroom.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Edward turns on a light, revealing that the bedroom has been 
decorated in keeping with the art deco theme of the penthouse. 
17.
Another large relief, this one of prancing unicorns, is mounted 
over the bed. The bed itself is enormous and covered with gray 
satin sheets and a rose comforter.
Edward walks over to the bed and picks up a mint lying on the 
pillow. He tosses it to Vivian.
Vivian catches it, unwraps it, and pops it into her mouth.
VIVIAN
(munching)
Can I have my money now?
EDWARD
Oh ... yes.
He reaches into his jacket and pulls out a money clip. He takes 
five fifties from it and hands them to her. It doesn't appear to 
diminish the size of the clip.
Vivian takes the money and stuffs it into her tiny purse.
VIVIAN
Thanks, honey.
She gives him a kiss. Edward returns it. Just as he is about to 
pull her into his arms she abruptly steps back from him.
She quickly undoes her clothes. She slips out of her shoes.
VIVIAN
So what would you like? Just a 
screw, or you want a blowjob first?
EDWARD
We'll ... play it by ear. See how 
it goes.
Vivian pulls off her blouse and skirt.
VIVIAN
That means you want the blowjob 
first.
Edward smiles, somewhat embarrassed by her bluntness.
EDWARD
Does it?
VIVIAN
Yeah. You don't mind wearing a 
rubber, do you?
EDWARD
Seems like a good precaution.
VIVIAN
You look clean but these days you 
never know. I don't do it in the 
ass, either ... unless you want to 
pay extra.
18.
She removes her panty hose. Naked but for a pair of black 
panties, she sits down on the floor and carefully lays her 
clothes out on the carpet, smoothing them down so they won't get 
wrinkled.
Edward sits on the bed and watches her, fascinated.
EDWARD
What are you doing?
VIVIAN
I don't want my clothes to get 
mushed up.
EDWARD
You could hang them in the closet.
VIVIAN
This is fine.
Vivian stands and walks to Edward. She gives him a quick peck on 
the cheek.
VIVIAN
Here, I'll help you out of your 
clothes.
She undoes his tie and pulls it from his shirt. Edward grabs her 
wrists, firmly but gently.
EDWARD
Hey. Slow down. I thought I had you 
for the whole night.
VIVIAN
(evenly)
Yeah, you got me. Just most guys 
like it quick.
EDWARD
Well, then I'm not like most guys.
Guiding her by the wrists, Edward slowly pushes her back onto 
the bed covers. He releases her and settles in beside her. He 
runs a finger across her thighs.
Vivian lies back in the bed covers, bored. Edward's fingers pet 
her stomach. Vivian winces.
VIVIAN
That tickles.
Edward smiles and touches her stomach again. Vivian sits up 
quickly.
VIVIAN
(firmly)
That tickles. I don't like it.
19.
EDWARD
Sorry. What do you like?
VIVIAN
(annoyed)
Hot baths and white rocks. Okay? If 
I want some guy to turn me on I'll 
pay you two-fifty. I'm here to make 
you feel good. So lay down.
Vivian pushes Edward back onto the bed. She unbuttons his shirt.
VIVIAN
Jesus, champagne, strawberries, 
mints, and foreplay. You act like 
you're seducing a Valley girl you 
picked up in a dance club.
Edward laughs. Vivian undoes his pants.
EDWARD
I'm an incurable romantic.
VIVIAN
Yeah. Well, you were cruising the 
wrong boulevard for romance.
(beat)
But if you want a good fuck, you 
found the best. Just lay down and 
let me drive.
Vivian lips off the bed and walks to the lights switch. She 
turns it off.
In the faint light that leaks through the cracks in the door, we 
see her return to Edward. She lies on top of him and kisses him 
full on the lips. Edward wraps his arms around her.
They make love.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
Vivian turns on a light. The bathroom is large, decorated in 
gray tile and gold trim. There is a huge sunken bathtub in the 
corner of the room.
Vivian looks at herself in the mirror. He hair is tangled and 
loose, and her body damp with sweat. With her fingers she combs 
out her hair to untangle it.
She unrolls a handful of toilet paper and wipes the sweat from 
her forehead and neck. She uses her finger to adjust the smeared 
line of her lipstick.
She turns off the light.
20.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Vivian is sitting on the floor picking up her clothes. Edward 
slides over on the bed to see her.
EDWARD
What are you doing?
VIVIAN
Getting my clothes.
EDWARD
I thought we had all night.
VIVIAN
What? You want to do it again? I 
thought I finished you off.
EDWARD
You did. But stay the night. I'd 
like to sleep with you. I'll get 
you a taxi in the morning.
Vivian sighs.
VIVIAN
Why do you want to sleep with me?
EDWARD
I don't like to sleep alone.
VIVIAN
Your girlfriend fucking spoils you.
EDWARD
She does.
Vivian stands up and walks over to the bed.
VIVIAN
Alright. Move over, Romeo.
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
The elevator doors open and a waiter rolls a cart out into the 
hallway. He takes it to the doors of the penthouse. He rings the 
bell.
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Edward, dressed in silk pajamas and a black velvet robe, stands 
in the living room talking into a cordless phone.
EDWARD
If you really miss me then take a 
plane and get out here.
The chimes ring. Edward covers the receiver with his hand.
21.
EDWARD
Come in! It's open.
The door opens and the waiter carries in a covered tray of food, 
a bottle of champagne, and a pitcher of orange juice.
EDWARD
Just set it down over there.
Edward points to a dining table in a corner of the room. The 
waiter does as requested.
Edward speaks back into the phone.
EDWARD
Cindy? Yes. I don't care what your 
agent says. A one-week vacation 
isn't going to ruin your career.
The waiter sets down the tray and returns through the living 
room. Edward picks up his wallet from an end table and hands the 
waiter a five-dollar bill. The waiter nods and exits.
EDWARD
I want you here. You know how I get 
when I'm doing business. Do you 
know how much this deal is worth?
Edward walks over to the dining table and lifts one of the tray 
covers. Inside is a gourmet breakfast.
EDWARD
(becoming angry)
You promised me when you started 
this whole modeling thing that I 
would still come first. Now I'm 
telling you to get out here. Today.
(beat)
Cindy!
She's hung up on him. Edward slams the phone down on the table.
EDWARD
Spoiled bitch.
Edward takes a deep breath to calm himself. He pours a glass of 
orange juice and takes a sip. Still agitated, he crosses through 
the living room to the bedroom door.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Vivian is asleep in the bed. She is not a light sleeper. He body 
is in an awkward position and her mouth is frozen half open on 
her tranquil face. She looks young and childlike.
Edward stares down at her for a moment. He sips his orange 
juice. He is thinking again. Making a decision.
22.
EDWARD
(loudly)
You're quite a sleeper.
Vivian stirs roughly.
EDWARD
Good morning. Would you like some 
breakfast?
Vivian's eyes open painfully and she squints at Edward. She 
shakes her head, trying to wake up.
VIVIAN
I forgot where I was.
EDWARD
That must be an occupational 
hazard.
EDWARD
This is a nice bed. It's so soft. I 
slept like a stiff.
EDWARD
Would you like some breakfast? It's 
still hot.
VIVIAN
I don't eat in the morning.
EDWARD
You should. Come on.
Edward picks up his shirt from the night before and tosses it to 
her.
INT. DINING TABLE IN THE LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Vivian wears Edward's shirt as they sit at the dining table. 
Edward dishes out some food and sets it in front of her.
VIVIAN
My head hurts. It's that champagne 
you made me choke down.
Edward pulls the champagne bottle from its bucket.
EDWARD
Some hair of the dog.
He deftly pops the cork.
VIVIAN
No. I'll get sick.
Edward fills a third of the glass and tops it off with orange 
juice.
23.
EDWARD
Just a bit. With orange juice. I 
guarantee it will make you feel 
better.
Vivian reluctantly takes the glass.
VIVIAN
I don't like orange juice either.
EDWARD
Don't you like anything?
Vivian swallows some orange juice.
VIVIAN
White rocks. Hot baths.
EDWARD
Well, you're welcome to take a nice 
long bath. The one in the bathroom 
is practically a pool.
VIVIAN
I saw it, but I have to go.
She picks up a fork and starts examining the food on her plate. 
Edward begins to eat.
EDWARD
I wanted to talk to you about that.
VIVIAN
What is this stuff?
She eats a forkful.
EDWARD
Crepes.
VIVIAN
It's good. The orange juice isn't 
that bad neither.
She takes another sip.
EDWARD
I'm going to be in town until next 
Friday. I'm involved in an 
important business deal and I'm not 
going to have the energy to try to 
chase down girls when I need to 
relax...
Vivian is wolfing down the food hungrily.
VIVIAN
(her mouth full)
You want my number? But I charge 
more on Saturdays. 
24.
(MORE)
Especially if you want to do the 
sleeping thing. I'd lose a lot of 
business.
EDWARD
Hey, slow down. I'm not going to 
take your plate away from you.
VIVIAN
Sorry. I guess I was hungry after 
all. So you want my number?
She finishes off her glass and refills it, this time favoring 
the champagne.
EDWARD
Actually, I was wondering if you 
would like to stay here for the 
week.
Vivian tries to conceal her surprise at his offer. Not many 
people are interested in her during the day. It takes her a 
moment to respond.
VIVIAN
(trying to act cool)
It'd cost ya.
EDWARD
How much? Let's see if I can afford 
it.
VIVIAN
Well, seven full nights and days, 
too?
EDWARD
Yes. You can do what you want 
during the days, but I'd like to 
have you on call, so to speak.
VIVIAN
Two thousand.
Edward sports the same faint smile that he always gets when he's 
negotiating money.
EDWARD
Hmmm. Two fifty a night for seven 
nights is only seventeen hundred 
and fifty dollars.
VIVIAN
But you want me during the days, 
too. And last night you didn't get 
me 'til after twelve. I did some 
good money before you picked me up.
EDWARD
I'm sure you did' but seven nights 
of steady work. 
25.
VIVIAN (CONT'D)
(MORE)
Shouldn't I get a discount or 
something? How about fifteen 
hundred?
VIVIAN
Don't be an asshole. You know 
you've got two thousand. This 
fucking room must cost you a couple 
hundred a night.
Edward smiles broadly at that. Vivian notices.
VIVIAN
Or more!
EDWARD
I like to know I'm getting my 
money's worth. I struck a good deal 
on this room, too.
VIVIAN
(firmly)
Two thousand.
Edward pours himself some more orange juice.
EDWARD
Alright. I like you. Two thousand 
it is. But let me tell you, I have 
very tough business to do. There is 
a lot of pressure involved. When I 
get tense, I need someone to help 
me relax. That means no problems. 
No hassles. Understand?
The thought of all that money is starting to warm Vivian's 
voice.
VIVIAN
Sure, honey. I'll treat you like a 
prince for a week. Anything, any 
way you want.
EDWARD
I'm not just talking about sex. I 
need some nice pleasant company.
VIVIAN
I'll treat you so nice you'll never 
want to let me go.
EDWARD
Fine. But I will go. This is only 
for a week. I want you to be clear 
on that, too.
VIVIAN
Hey, I'll be looking forward to 
spending my money when you're gone.
Edward smiles.
26.
EDWARD (CONT'D)
EDWARD
I wish my lawyer was that honest. 
So it's a deal?
VIVIAN
I need to go back to Hollywood and 
get some things.
EDWARD
No, I want you to stay here while 
you're with me. I don't want any 
trouble. We'll buy anything you 
need. What do you want?
Vivian smiles awkwardly.
VIVIAN
Well, a little bit of rock. Just to 
get me through the week. I'll pay 
for it myself.
EDWARD
No. No drugs. Not while you're with 
me.
VIVIAN
I just need a little buzz. It's no 
different than champagne.
EDWARD
Champagne is legal. Drugs are 
illegal. That's enough of a 
difference to me.
VIVIAN
I can't go a whole week without 
getting high.
EDWARD
(shrugs)
Then I'll have to call Room Service 
and get another girl.
Vivian sits in silence for a moment. Edward watches her for the 
corner of his eye. He enjoys negotiating. Vivian's face 
toughens. She looks at Edward levelly.
VIVIAN
Alright. A week. But I want three 
thousand.
Edward studies her for a moment. He knows when to close a deal.
EDWARD
That's fair. Hardship pay. Three 
thousand dollars for one week, no 
drugs, no strings attached.
VIVIAN
It's a deal.
27.
INT. BATHROOM - MORNING
Vivian is stretched out in a hot bubble bath. Her face shows 
almost orgasmic pleasure. She starts to laugh.
VIVIAN
Three thousand! Three thousand 
fucking dollars!
Laughing, she lays back and sinks down into the warm bubbly 
water and disappears.
She pops back up, shakes out her hair and laughs again.
VIVIAN
Three thousand!
Edward comes into the bathroom and stands by the door, watching 
her laugh. He has just finished dressing and is trying to get 
his tie tied.
EDWARD
Happy, huh?
VIVIAN
Listen, lover. When I'm not giving 
you the best fucks of your life, 
I'm gonna be right here, in this 
tub. Have Room Service bring the 
cart in.
She laughs.
VIVIAN
Three thousand. To sit in a bathtub 
for seven days.
EDWARD
I'm overpaying you, aren't I?
VIVIAN
Hey, I'd have taken a thousand, but 
we both know you can put up three, 
can't you?
EDWARD
(smoothly)
I don't think it will break me.
VIVIAN
Then it's a good deal for us both. 
I'll keep you happy, lover.
EDWARD
Good. I've got to meet with some 
people. I'll probably be gone most 
of the day.
VIVIAN
I'll be right here.
28.
Edward is still struggling with his tie.
EDWARD
I can never get these things right. 
Cindy always does them for me. Do 
you know how to do these?
Vivian slides over to the edge of the tub and wipes her hands on 
a towel.
VIVIAN
Let me see.
Edward walks over to the tub and leans over. Vivian reaches up 
and tries to tie his tie.
VIVIAN
How does this go?
She makes a mess of it. She undoes it and tries again.
EDWARD
Forget it. You're killing my back.
VIVIAN
No, let me try again. I got to 
learn how to spoil you like your 
girlfriend does.
Edward continues to hunch over. Vivian finally gets something 
that is almost close.
VIVIAN
There.
Edward straightens up and glances in a mirror.
EDWARD
Close enough. You have the rest of 
the week to practice.
Edward reaches into his wallet and pulls out his American 
Express Gold Card. He sets it down on the sink.
EDWARD
Here. Buy some nice clothes on 
Rodeo Drive. A few dresses, but not 
too fancy, or too sexy. Soft pinks 
and pastels are nice. I just want 
you to look presentable in the 
hotel, understand?
VIVIAN
Yeah. You want me to dress like 
your high-class girlfriend.
EDWARD
Well, let's hope you don't spend 
that much.
29.
VIVIAN
How much can I spend?
EDWARD
Be reasonable. You seem like a 
smart girl. I'll make you a deal. 
If you spend too much I'll send it 
all back at the end of the week. If 
you're sensible, I'll let you keep 
it. Fair?
VIVIAN
Fair.
Edward walks over and kisses her on the cheek.
EDWARD
Bye.
VIVIAN
Bye, lover. It's gonna be a fun 
week.
Edward smiles and exits. Vivian relaxes back in her tub.
VIVIAN
Three ... thousand ... dollars.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Vivian is back in her street clothes, lounging about on an art 
deco couch, talking on the cordless phone.
VIVIAN
You wouldn't believe it, babe. It's 
like out of Dynasty or something. 
It's a gas. He's leaving next 
Friday. I'll be back then.
We hear Kit's voice on the other end of the phone.
KIT (O.S.)
But Viv, I don't have any money. 
What will I do 'til you get back?
VIVIAN
Work, baby. You're supposed to be 
working. I'm not your mother. I'll 
handle the rent, you just keep 
yourself going for a week. Pick up 
some blowjobs. You can do that.
KIT (O.S.) 
(softly)
Okay.
VIVIAN
Listen, baby. I'm making good 
money. Good money. 
30.
(MORE)
When I get back we're gonna move to 
the Strip and work the good part of 
town. Just like I promised. We'll 
get a nice place, not like that 
shithole we're in now. I always 
told you I could get the class 
tricks.
KIT (O.S.)
That's cause you're pretty, Viv. 
But I don't think I could work the 
Strip. I'm not pretty like you.
VIVIAN
Babe, I'm telling you we'll get 
your hair done up right and you'll 
be a knockout. Okay?
KIT (O.S.)
Okay.
VIVIAN
You take care of yourself. I'll be 
back in a week. It's not that long.
KIT (O.S.)
Okay.
VIVIAN
Bye, baby.
KIT (O.S.)
Bye.
Vivian presses a button to hang up the phone and sets it down on 
the table. She leans back in the couch, happy and comfortable. 
She pulls the American Express card from her pocket and admires 
it.
VIVIAN
Time to shop.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Vivian is dressed in her street clothes, without the black 
stockings, white coat, or heavy makeup. She doesn't look quite 
so much like a hooker, but she's not altogether respectable, 
either.
She is waiting for the elevator. When the doors open she 
saunters inside.
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
The Elevator Operator is standing by the controls as Vivian 
comes in. He notices, but tries not to stare at her out-of-place 
attire.
VIVIAN
(cheerfully)
Hi.
31.
VIVIAN (CONT'D)
OPERATOR
Hello. Lobby?
VIVIAN
Yeah.
The elevator starts down.
VIVIAN
I'm going to be staying here for 
awhile.
The Operator nods.
OPERATOR
Excellent.
Vivian smiles at him. He reluctantly returns it. The elevator 
reaches the bottom floor and the doors open.
VIVIAN
I'll be back.
The Operator nods as she steps into the lobby.
INT. LOBBY - DAY
Vivian gets strange looks from the hotel employees and customers 
as she strolls through the lobby.
At first she shrugs off the obvious rejection she sees in their 
eyes, but after getting the same reaction from each person she 
sees in the lobby, her savior faire begins to erode.
When she reaches the front door she hurries through it, eager to 
be away from them.
EXT. HOTEL - DAY
Vivian comes out onto Wilshire Blvd. and looks around. She is 
less confident and excited than she was before. She's feeling a 
little lost in this strange place.
She crosses the street and heads up Rodeo Drive.
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
Vivian passes store windows, looking at the expensive things 
inside. Something about it all makes her jittery.
She comes to a posh women's boutique. She hesitates for a moment 
and then enters.
INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY
Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the 
disapproving stare of a Saleswoman, standing behind the counter.
32.
SALESWOMAN
(with a Beverly Hills 
sneer)
Can I help you?
VIVIAN
I'm just looking.
Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with 
delicate glass objects. She cautiously examines a dress.
The Saleswoman, unhappy with Vivian's clothes, appearance, and 
voice, quickly comes around the counter and approaches her.
SALESWOMAN
Are you looking for something in 
particular?
VIVIAN
I need some new clothes.
SALESWOMAN
(sarcastically)
Yes.
Vivian eyes the Saleswoman suspiciously. She's beginning to get 
the drift. She points to a dress.
VIVIAN
How much is that?
SALESWOMAN
I don't think it would fit you.
VIVIAN
(claws coming out)
I didn't ask if it would fit. I 
asked how much.
SALESWOMAN
It's very expensive.
Vivian's body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman, violence 
in her eyes.
VIVIAN
What's with you?
SALESWOMAN
(unblinking)
Pardon?
VIVIAN
What's with this fucking look on 
your face?
SALESWOMAN
I think you should leave. You're 
obviously in the wrong place.
33.
Vivian is so angry and frustrated she is speechless.
SALESWOMAN
Please leave.
Vivian turns and stomps toward the door. She stops and spins 
around staring at the Saleswoman incredulously.
VIVIAN
I was going to spend fucking money 
here! What's with you?
The Saleswoman says nothing. Vivian flips her off. She throws 
the door open and storms outside.
The Saleswoman calmly walks back to her counter and returns to 
her place.
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost. A man passes, 
eyeing Vivian as if she were a freak. Vivian's face is red. He 
eyes water up to cry. She takes a deep breath, trying to control 
herself.
She looks up and down for another shop. On the street, women in 
elegant designer outfits stroll by. Vivian suddenly feels naked.
She heads back to the hotel.
INT. HOTEL - DAY
Vivian enters the lobby, nervous and paranoid. She heads toward 
the elevators. She feels an emptiness in her stomach at the 
sight of all the luxury around her. Only this time she doesn't 
have Edward to guide her. She is surrounded by it but not a part 
of it.
Mr. Thomas, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, spots her. He 
crosses the room and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.
MR. THOMAS
May I help you, miss?
Vivian stops, practically shaking with terror.
VIVIAN
I'm just going up to my room.
MR. THOMAS
You're a guest here?
VIVIAN
I'm... I'm with a friend.
MR. THOMAS
And who is that?
34.
VIVIAN
Edward...
Vivian's face fills with terror. She doesn't know his last name. 
He hands are trembling.
MR. THOMAS
What's the matter?
VIVIAN
I'm ...
The elevator doors open behind them. She spots the Operator.
VIVIAN
(blurting it out)
He knows me!
Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously. The Operator 
looks back at them innocently. With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas 
waves the Operator over.
MR. THOMAS
Do you know this young lady?
The Operator nods.
OPERATOR
She's with Mr. Harris.
MR. THOMAS
(Surprised)
Mr. Harris?
OPERATOR
She joined him last night, 
apparently.
VIVIAN
(voice quaking)
I just want to go back to my room.
Mr. Thomas' tone toward Vivian changes dramatically. He waves 
the Operator away.
MR. THOMAS
Are you alright?
VIVIAN
I just want to go back to my room.
MR. THOMAS
Why don't you come with me? We'll 
chat for a moment.
He takes her by the arm and leads her off.
35.
INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY
In a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a 
comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk. 
As he addresses her, his voice is firm, but warm. Fatherly.
MR. THOMAS
My dear, I want you to understand 
that there are certain things that 
don't happen in the Beverly 
Wilshire. Things that go on in 
other hotels. You understand?
Vivian says nothing.
MR. THOMAS
But Mr. Harris is a very special 
customer of this hotel. And we like 
to think of our special customers 
as friends. As a customer, I would 
expect Mr. Harris to sign in any 
additional guests that he wants to 
spend the night. But as a friend, 
we're willing to overlook it. I'm 
assuming you're a relative. You 
must be his niece.
Vivian finds herself nodding.
MR. THOMAS
Of course. Naturally when Mr. 
Harris leaves, I won't see you in 
this hotel again. Correct?
Vivian nods.
MR. THOMAS
I would also encourage you to dress 
in a more appropriate manner.
Vivian quickly pulls out her American Express card and hands it 
to him as if it somehow validates her actions.
VIVIAN
I was trying to get some other 
clothes... but... they wouldn't...
She can't go on. Mr. Thomas politely glances at the American 
Express card and hands it back to her. He sighs wearily. The 
things he must do to keep his "friends" happy.
He walks around his desk and picks up the phone. He dials a 
number.
MR. THOMAS
(into the phone)
Women's clothing.
(beat)
Could I speak to Bridget.
(pause)
Bridget, hello. 
36.
(MORE)
This is Mr. Thomas at the Beverly 
Wilshire. Well, that's flattering. 
Listen, I'm going to send someone 
to you. She's the distant niece of 
a special customer of ours. A very 
special customer: Mr. Harris. Yes, 
the Long Island Harrises. His niece 
is... from out of town. You know. 
And she needs a little help 
dressing. Maybe you could help he 
pick something. Thank you very 
much. She'll be right over.
Mr Thomas sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at 
Vivian.
MR. THOMAS
There you are. Go to Saks down the 
street. It's a tall black building 
not far from here, thankfully. Go 
straight to the second floor and 
ask for Bridget. She'll take care 
of you.
Vivian stands up. She's calmer now.
VIVIAN
Thanks.
MR. THOMAS
If you have any other problems come 
ask for me personally. I'm Mr. 
Thomas.
Vivian nods. He shows her to the door. She exits. He watches her 
go, unhappy about the whole matter.
INT. SAKS - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
The elevator opens and Vivian walks out and surveys the room 
nervously. She wanders toward the women's clothing section.
Bridget, a large friendly woman, spots her.
BRIDGET
You must be Mr. Harris' niece.
Vivian nods.
BRIDGET
What's your name, dear?
VIVIAN
Vivian.
VIVIAN
Well, the mini-skirt is dead, 
Vivian. I don't care how many 
designers try to bring it back, 
it's dead. Goodness, you look like 
a streetwalker in that. Let's find 
you something else. Come on.
37.
MR. THOMAS (CONT'D)
Bridget leads Vivian into the racks of clothes.
BRIDGET
Where are you from dear?
Vivian is silent for awhile.
VIVIAN
Ohio.
BRIDGET
No wonder. How about this?
Bridget holds up a brown designer dress.
VIVIAN
(timidly)
Do you have anything in soft pink?
Bridget studies Vivian for a moment.
BRIDGET
Like a pastel?
INT. SAKS - DAY
Vivian is dressed in a pink pastel dress with fine white beading 
around the neck and shoulders and a tiny lace collar.
BRIDGET
You look lovely.
Vivian nods. She seems dazed and weary. She hands Bridget the 
American Express card. Bridget takes it.
BRIDGET
Do you have any shoes for it?
Vivian shakes her head. Bridget leads her off.
BRIDGET
Come, come.
INT. SAKS - DAY
Bridget is ringing up Vivian's new dress and matching hat, 
purse, and shoes. She packs Vivian's old clothes in a paper bag. 
She hands Vivian the small credit card form.
BRIDGET
Just sign here.
Vivian signs.
BRIDGET
We have a salon on the third floor. 
Maybe you'd like to get your hair 
and nails done?
38.
Vivian glances at her nails. They are a hideous shade of bright 
red.
BRIDGET
Go on. It's a treat. By the time 
you get back to Ohio they'll think 
you were born in Beverly Hills.
EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. - DAY
Vivian's nails are pink. Her hair is cut and styled more 
conservatively and done up in a bun. She wears a soft white hat 
and pink shoes and a pink dress. In her hands is a pink and 
white purse. He makeup has been redone. She walks down Wilshire, 
still quiet and dazed. But lovely.
She carries a bag with her working clothes. She stops at a 
trashcan and throws the offending items away. Hoping no one 
notices.
She approaches the hotel and pauses. He eyes are drawn to the 
other side of the street: Rodeo Drive. It seems ominous to her.
She takes a breath and crosses the street.
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
Vivian walks up Rodeo Drive again. Her manner is uneasy, but 
determined, as if forced to stroll down a dangerous street on a 
dare. She is better armed this time, in a suit of impenetrable 
pink armor.
She darts by the boutique that kicked her out, trying not to be 
seen by the saleswoman on the other side of the window.
She continues on to another shop. She takes a breath and enters.
INT. ANOTHER BOUTIQUE - DAY
Vivian strolls through the store, poker-faced but weak at the 
knees. She stops at a dress and fingers it.
Another Saleswoman comes up alongside her.
ANOTHER SALESWOMAN
It's very pretty. Would you like to 
try it on?
Vivian turns and looks at the saleswoman for a moment. Blood 
flows back to her skin. Vivian flashes a trademark Beverly Hills 
bitch sneer.
VIVIAN
Why not?
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
Vivian strolls up the street, carrying a clothing box. Her step 
is lively, and her face has a trace of a snotty smile.
39.
A well-dressed man passes by, smiling politely. Vivian's nose 
lifts as she happily ignores him.
She heads for another shop
INT. BOUTIQUE #3 - DAY
Vivian is in a dressing stall, tossing a dress outside to a 
Nervous Saleswoman.
VIVIAN
Nope.
Another Nervous Saleswoman comes up, holding a long purple 
evening gown.
A.N.S.
How about this one?
VIVIAN
Ick! I want something in a pastel. 
That's horrid.
The Nervous Saleswoman is frantically hanging up some of the 
other clothes Vivian tried on.
NERVOUS SALESWOMAN
There's a mint green dress in the 
window...?
VIVIAN
Yes! Let me try that on.
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY
Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags. She has 
perfected her Beverly Hills sneer. She owns this block.
On her way back to the hotel she returns to the first boutique. 
Without a beat of hesitation she marches in.
INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY
Vivian, her hat partially obscuring her face from the 
Saleswoman, sails into the store carrying all her boxes and 
bags. The Saleswoman smiles to herself. Obviously a professional 
shopper.
Vivian strides over to the dress she originally looked at. She 
fingers it roughly.
SALESWOMAN
(eagerly)
Isn't it pretty? It's on sale.
Vivian abruptly faces the Saleswoman and stares at her coldly.
VIVIAN
It wouldn't fit me.
40.
Vivian marches toward the front door. She turns back to the 
Saleswoman, who is trying to remember who Vivian is.
Vivian flips her off again, just to remind her.
VIVIAN
(coolly)
Bye.
Vivian exits. The Saleswoman stares after her.
INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - DAY
Vivian walks confidently through the hotel lobby, past the 
admiring gazes of several businessmen. She enters the elevator.
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
In the elevator, Vivian gripping her packages like loot from a 
conquered city. The Operator doesn't recognize her. He starts 
the elevator up.
OPERATOR
Floor, ma'am?
VIVIAN
(smoothly)
Penthouse.
The Operator does a double take. Vivian smiles at him.
VIVIAN
Hi again. Like my new dress?
OPERATOR
It's... lovely.
VIVIAN
Mr. Thomas picked it out for me.
OPERATOR
Oh...?
They reach the top floor. The doors open. Vivian steps out.
VIVIAN
Bye.
The Operator watches her go.
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - SUNSET
Vivian, still in her pink dress but without the hat, stands in 
front of the glass windows, staring out into the city 
reflectively.
41.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING
Edward steps to the front desk and catches the eye of a Desk 
Clerk.
EDWARD
Any messages?
DESK CLERK
Yes, Mr. Harris.
He hands Edward a few message slips and a telegram. Edward sorts 
through them. He is tired and on edge.
Mr. Thomas, standing at the other end of the front desk, sees 
Edward. He deftly approaches him and speaks in a low intimate 
voice.
MR. THOMAS
Good evening, Mr. Harris.
Edward continues looking through his messages.
EDWARD
(absently)
Hello.
MR. THOMAS
I met your ... "niece" in the lobby 
today.
EDWARD
(looking up)
My niece?
MR. THOMAS
That pretty young girl staying in 
your room. I just assumed...
Edward's and Mr. Thomas' eyes meet. They are engaging in some 
sort of subtle power struggle, a struggle that Edward intends to 
win.
EDWARD
I don't have a niece.
MR. THOMAS
Ah, my mistake.
EDWARD
That pretty young girl in my room 
is a prostitute.
Mr. Thomas can't think how to respond.
EDWARD
Do you have a problem with that?
42.
MR. THOMAS
(softly)
No, sir. Have a good evening.
Mr. Thomas bows slightly and walks away. Edward watches him go 
and turns back to the Desk Clerk, suddenly in a good mood.
EDWARD
Have some champagne sent up. And a 
cheese tray or something. Maybe a 
p?t and some bread. A large bottle 
of mineral water. And strawberries.
DESK CLERK
Yes, sir.
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Vivian is sitting demurely on the couch when Edward comes in 
from the hall. She stands up and looks at him. She smoothes her 
dress anxiously.
VIVIAN
Do you like it?
Edward strolls down the steps to the living room, studying her. 
He smiles.
EDWARD
It's lovely.
Vivian sighs with relief.
VIVIAN
I had my hair done. I hope that was 
okay.
EDWARD
Yes. I like it.
Edward gives her a quick kiss and sits down in a chair, 
exhausted. He loosens his tie and uses one foot to try to slide 
the shoe off the other. It's stuck. He reaches down to untie the 
shoe, but before he can Vivian practically throws herself at his 
feet.
VIVIAN
Here, let me help you.
Vivian kneels at his feet and unties his shoes. She pulls them 
off and sets them down next to the chair.
VIVIAN
Socks too?
EDWARD
That's alright. My feet were just 
swelling up.
(pause)
43.
(MORE)
I had an interesting talk with the 
hotel manager downstairs.
VIVIAN
(looking down)
Oh.
Edward takes Vivian's chin in one hand and raises her head. He 
looks into her eyes.
EDWARD
Listen to me. I don't know what 
happened with you two, but I don't 
care. I'm paying a bundle for this 
room and I expect to be treated 
with respect. That includes you. If 
anyone hassles you, or makes you 
feel uncomfortable, you tell me. 
I'll see that they're fired 
promptly. That includes Mr. Thomas. 
Understand?
VIVIAN
(happily)
Yeah.
EDWARD
I don't care whether you're a 
prostitute, my wife, my niece, or 
the First Lady. As long as you're 
my guest, the people in this hotel 
will treat you like a queen. 
Alright? If I have to, I'll buy the 
hotel and burn it down to prove my 
point.
Vivian smiles brightly. He lets go of her chin and relaxes in 
his chair.
EDWARD
Now, it looks as if you did some 
shopping...
Vivian reaches over to the end table and picks up a pile of 
credit card receipts.
VIVIAN
I saved all the receipts. I bought 
three dresses and some other stuff. 
That hat over there goes with this 
dress.
EDWARD
Only three dresses?
VIVIAN
Well, I didn't figure I'd be going 
out a lot. And clothes are so 
expensive around here. 
44.
EDWARD (CONT'D)
(MORE)
I got two of them on sale, but even 
then it all came to eight hundred 
and fifty-seven dollars. I could 
have done better at Sears or 
something but...
EDWARD
That's fine. You could teach Cindy 
a lesson in saving money.
VIVIAN
(eagerly)
You want to see what I bought?
Edward couldn't care less, but he decides to indulge her.
EDWARD
Yes, I'd love to.
Vivian jumps up, runs to the couch, and picks one of the boxes 
she brought home. She opens it to reveal a long mint green 
dress.
She unzips her dress and pulls it off. Underneath she is wearing 
a soft pink teddy. She picks up the green dress and starts to 
put it on.
EDWARD
(smiling)
New underwear too?
Vivian stops pulling up her green dress. She lets it drop to the 
floor and models the teddy.
VIVIAN
Yeah, like it?
EDWARD
Very much.
VIVIAN
Good, I got another one that 
matches this dress.
She steps out of the green dress and runs over to a bag 
containing some underwear. She throws off the pink teddy and 
puts on the green one.
VIVIAN
How's that?
EDWARD
Nice.
VIVIAN
And I got a white one too, for my 
yellow dress. I couldn't find a 
yellow one.
She holds up the white teddy.
45.
VIVIAN (CONT'D)
VIVIAN
I kinda thought they were sexy. But 
classy too...
EDWARD
Yes.
The front door chimes.
EDWARD
That's Room Service.
VIVIAN
(joking)
Maybe I should answer it in my 
teddy. Give him a thrill?
EDWARD
Let's not.
VIVIAN
(embarrassed)
No. I wasn't going to. I was just 
kidding.
Vivian pulls on the mint green dress. She zips up and darts up 
the steps to the door. She pulls the door open to reveal a 
Bellboy with a tray of food.
BELLBOY
Room Service.
VIVIAN
Come on in. Put it down there.
The Bellboy carries the tray down the stairs. He sets it down 
and returns to the door. Without getting up from the chair, 
Edward hands him a five-dollar bill as he passes.
After he has exited, Vivian shuts the door.
Edward wearily gets up and walks over to the tray of food. He 
pulls the champagne from the bucket and pops the cork. He pours 
a glass for Vivian. He opens the mineral water and pours some 
into a champagne glass.
As Vivian comes down the steps Edward hands her the champagne. 
Vivian takes it. Edward holds up his glass of water.
EDWARD
Cheers.
They clink their glasses together. Vivian quickly sips the 
champagne.
VIVIAN
I'm starting to like this stuff.
She returns to her clothes and takes off her green dress.
46.
VIVIAN
Let me show you the yellow one.
She pulls it from the box and puts it on. It has a conservative, 
almost businesslike look to it.
VIVIAN
Like it?
Edward carries the bottle of champagne over to her and refills 
her glass. He kisses her.
EDWARD
I like it. I'm pleased.
Vivian takes another long swallow of champagne.
VIVIAN
Great. Now I'll show you the good 
stuff.
EDWARD
The good stuff?
VIVIAN
(between champagne sips)
Well, I figured you weren't going 
to be taking me out a lot, so I 
figured what I really needed was 
some sexy lingerie for when I was 
in.
Vivian moves over to another set of boxes. She pauses and eyes 
Edward suggestively.
VIVIAN
Why don't you relax while I show 
you?
Edward sits down.
Montage of Vivian's outpits
As Edward sits in the chair Vivian changes from outfit to 
outfit.
She slides up to him in a sexy long white lace and silk 
nightgown. She does a turn so he can see it.
He smiles. Vivian tosses the nightgown into his lap as she tries 
on something else.
She takes a long sip from her champagne glass as she shows him a 
sexy pair of red tap pants and matching camisole.
Edward refills her glass as she shows him a black corset and 
long stockings.
Vivian tosses the stockings onto Edward. He is accumulating a 
pile of lingerie on his lap.
47.
Vivian comes up to him in a short bright pink nightie. Very 
drunk, she sits on his lap and finishes off the last of her 
champagne.
She lets the glass drop to the carpet and kisses him.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Edward carries a drunk Vivian into the bedroom and gently lays 
her out on the bed.
VIVIAN
Did I do good?
Edward rolls her into the covers.
EDWARD
Yes.
He takes off his coat and shirt.
VIVIAN
I got most of it at this great 
sale. A lot of it is polyester, but 
that white one is real silk.
Edward pulls off his pants and climbs into bed with her. She 
pulls him into her arms and snuggles up to him drunkenly.
VIVIAN
It only cost around two thirty-
five.
EDWARD
You did very well.
VIVIAN
(a little worried)
Are you going to let me keep it 
all?
EDWARD
Yes. It's yours.
Vivian's eyes light up. She kisses Edward passionately.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Vivian and Edward eat breakfast at the living room dining table. 
Vivian is dressed in one of her sexy nightgowns.
VIVIAN
What do you do all day while you're 
gone?
48.
EDWARD
Meet with lawyers and stockbrokers. 
Read financial reports. It's pretty 
boring.
VIVIAN
What's it for?
EDWARD
I'm acquiring a company.
VIVIAN
What kind of company?
EDWARD
It's called Kross Enterprises. It 
used to build ships. Nowadays it 
doesn't do much of anything.
VIVIAN
Why would you want it?
Edward takes a sip of his orange juice and looks at Vivian 
sideways.
EDWARD
Are you really curious?
VIVIAN
Yeah.
EDWARD
Alright. Warn me if I bore you. 
Twenty years ago Kross was a huge 
corporation, and even though 
they're on the verge of bankruptcy 
today they still have millions in 
assets. Things like real estate, 
equipment, pension funds. Things 
that can be liquidated to generate 
cash. You understand?
VIVIAN
What are pension funds?
EDWARD
That's cash invested in various 
accounts. It's supposed to be used 
to pay worker's retirement and 
health benefits. Sometimes it's 
hard to get at because of various 
government laws, but with good 
lawyers you can usually strip them 
down since only part of them have 
been contractually promised to the 
employees. Anyhow, we figure Kross 
is worth about 400 million. We hope 
we can acquire it for between two 
and three hundred million. No 
matter what, I'm going to make a 
profit. The question is how large.
49.
VIVIAN
(thinking hard)
If it's worth that much money, why 
doesn't somebody else try to buy 
it?
EDWARD
Try is the key word there. Other 
people have tried. But not that 
many people have a few hundred 
million to toy around with like 
this. And I know about assets the 
corporation owns that other people 
aren't aware of. Financial 
statements say the corporation is 
only worth around 300 million. I 
know it's worth more than that. In 
fact, it may be worth even more 
than 400 million, if I'm right 
about certain things. We'll see. 
The other problem is that the 
management of the company isn't 
particularly happy about the idea 
of being sold, because they'll lose 
their jobs.
VIVIAN
Oh.
EDWARD
I wouldn't lose any sleep over 
them. They got the corporation into 
mess it's in now.
VIVIAN
So you can make all that money just 
by buying it and then selling 
everything?
EDWARD
It's not quite that simple, but 
yes.
VIVIAN
(admiringly)
What a racket!
EDWARD
(smiling)
Yes.
VIVIAN
Is that how you got so rich? Buying 
companies?
EDWARD
No. It's been passed down through 
the family. But I have more than 
tripled it in the last seven years. 
These are good days for making 
money.
50.
VIVIAN
That's great.
Edward shrugs.
EDWARD
I'm going to have to get dressed, I 
have a meeting at ten. Tomorrow 
I'll give you a lesson in short 
selling.
VIVIAN
(happily)
Okay.
EDWARD
You're a good listener. I like 
that.
He stands up and gives her a kiss on the cheek.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Edward, fully dressed, is standing at the front door as Vivian 
ties his tie. She finishes.
VIVIAN
There you go.
EDWARD
How does it look? Do I need to 
check it?
VIVIAN
No. I've got it down. It looks 
great.
They kiss.
EDWARD
I'll see you this evening.
He exits. Vivian stands by the door for a moment and then walks 
down the living room steps.
She opens a large cabinet in the wall that conceals a 
television. She switches it on and sits on the couch.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Vivian is stretched out on the couch. She had been watching 
television for hours. She flips through the channels using a 
remote control. There's nothing on.
She turns the television off. She lays her head down on the 
couch and stares off, bored.
51.
INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY
Edward is being led through the hallways of a brokerage house by 
Vance, a well-dressed young stockbroker.
VANCE
We can't buy any more stock without 
filing. I just can't conceal it any 
longer. We might hide it under 
another name for a week or two, but 
we could get into trouble later.
EDWARD
No, no. Let's play by the rules. 
We'll just have to move quickly.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Vivian is on the phone.
VIVIAN
How about hamburgers? Do you have 
any hamburgers? Great. And fries. 
And ketchup. Yeah. I'm in the 
penthouse. The penthouse on the top 
floor. Right.
EXT. HELIPORT ON TOP OF SKYSCRAPER - DAY
Edward and Vance come out of a doorway onto the rooftop of a 
large skyscraper. There is a sleek corporate helicopter waiting 
on a landing pad. Edward and Vance lower their heads as they 
fight through the wind generated by the rotor blades.
As they near the helicopter, a young man in a business suit, 
Jake, comes out to greet them. They all have to shout over the 
sound of the engines.
VANCE
Mr. Harris, this is Jake Conway. 
He's our top researcher. He'll be 
giving us the tour.
JAKE
It's a pleasure, Mr. Harris.
EDWARD
Good to meet you.
They all climb into the helicopter. It takes off.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
An empty plate that once held a hamburger sits on the dining 
room table. Vivian stands in front of the plate glass windows, 
staring out onto the city.
52.
INT. LOBBY - DAY
Vivian comes out of the elevator wearing her mint green dress. 
She strolls through the lobby on her way to the hotel dry goods 
store.
She spots Mr. Thomas. With a wicked look on her face she walks 
up behind him and puts an arm on his shoulder.
VIVIAN
Hi. How are you?
Mr. Thomas looks at her uncomfortably.
MR. THOMAS
Fine. Hello.
VIVIAN
How do you like my dress? Better, 
hey?
MR. THOMAS
It's very pretty. The color is very 
good on you.
VIVIAN
Thanks. See ya.
She smiles brightly and saunters off. Mr. Thomas watches her go, 
more amused than annoyed at her.
INT. DRY GOODS STORE - DAY
Vivian buys a pack of cigarettes.
INT. BATH ROOM - DAY
Vivian sits in the bathtub smoking a cigarette. It isn't 
satisfying. She tears off the filter and takes a few drags.
She gives up and tosses it into the toilet. She sinks into the 
tub.
VIVIAN
How the fuck am I going to last a 
week?
EXT. PORT OF LOS ANGELES - DAY
A helicopter flies over the port.
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
They look over a huge shipyard as Jake describes it for Edward.
53.
JAKE
This is the jewel in Kross' crown. 
Prime industrial property 
straddling the Port of Long Beach 
and Los Angeles. We can strip out 
all the heavy equipment. Some of 
the cranes are very valuable 
overseas. World War II stuff that 
nobody builds anymore because it 
costs too much. The Japanese are 
salivating for them.
Edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard.
EDWARD
What's that long building over 
there?
JAKE
Waste processing plant. They don't 
use it anymore. Most of the yard 
we'll just level. The real estate 
possibilities are endless. In fact, 
I talked to a couple developers -- 
under the table, of course -- and 
they said we could...
EDWARD
(cutting him off)
You what?
JAKE
(tentatively)
I talked to some developers about 
the land.
EDWARD
What kind of idiot are you? You 
don't talk to anyone about this but 
me!
JAKE
I'm sorry, sir. They're close 
friends; they'd never breath a 
word.
Edward glares at Vance.
EDWARD
Where did you dig this moron up?
Vance turns to Jake, angrily.
VANCE
He's absolutely right, Jake. That 
was an incredibly stupid thing to 
do.
EDWARD
You people are supposed to be 
professionals.
54.
VANCE
It won't happen again. I'll pull 
Jake off the project.
EDWARD
No. Don't bother. He's probably 
already told everyone he knows.
JAKE
I'm very sorry, Mr. Harris.
EDWARD
Forget it. Let's go up the coast. I 
want to look around.
INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY
Edward, Vance, and Jake enter a large meeting room. Sitting at 
one end of a long conference table, piles of papers spread out 
before him, is William, a crafty-looking lawyer with wire-rimmed 
glasses. Edward smiles broadly upon seeing him.
EDWARD
Bill! Where the hell have you been?
WILLIAM
Working on your damned pension 
funds. I've found the angle. We can 
bleed them dry.
EDWARD
Yeah, if your boys at the brokerage 
haven't already leaked the whole 
deal.
WILLIAM
Leaked! What?
EDWARD
Skip it. Jake's going to be good 
from now on...
(to Jake)
...aren't you?
Edward gives Jake a friendly pat on the shoulder.
JAKE
(quietly)
Yes, sir.
EDWARD
Listen, there's something you need 
to look into right away. There's a 
chemical treatment plant at that 
shipyard. I want you to see if the 
permits are still valid. And what 
kind of limits are on them.
55.
WILLIAM
Treatment plant? What... oh! You 
son of a bitch! What a brain!
EDWARD
Don't get too excited yet. Check 
the permits first.
Edward sits down next to William. He glances back at the other 
two men.
EDWARD
Thanks for the tour. Keep your 
mouths shut. I'll see you tomorrow.
BOTH
Yes, sir.
They exit. William glances at Edward quizzically.
WILLIAM
What are you ragging them about?
EDWARD
Ask them. Where are we at?
WILLIAM
The Board knows.
EDWARD
Do they know it's me?
WILLIAM
Yes. A call came down from Kross. 
He wants to talk to you alone.
EDWARD
(laughing)
About what?
WILLIAM
Your intentions.
EDWARD
Alright.
WILLIAM
I don't think you should.
EDWARD
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
WILLIAM
I'll have to be present when you 
talk.
EDWARD
No. Everyone knows you're my 
muscle. 
56.
(MORE)
If the three of us sit down 
together then we might as well 
announce it in the Wall Street 
Journal. I'll meet him in public 
for dinner. Less suspicious. 
Tonight, if you can arrange it.
WILLIAM
I can. But you shouldn't go alone. 
He might claim that you tried to 
blackmail him or something.
EDWARD
I'll bring a girl. That'll keep it 
all on a friendly level.
WILLIAM
That might do. You brought Cindy 
along?
EDWARD
No, the little cunt's in New York, 
pretending she's a model. World's 
only five-foot two-inch model. But 
I've got a little girl to keep me 
company while I'm here. She'll do 
for the evening.
WILLIAM
Alright. I'll set it up.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Vivian, dressed in a teddy, is dozing on the couch with the TV 
on.
The phone rings. Vivian wakes up with a start. She looks at it, 
unsure. It rings again. She debates whether to pick up up. It 
rings again.
Finally she picks it up.
VIVIAN
Hello?
EDWARD (O.S.) 
(firmly)
Don't ever pick up the phone. Ever.
VIVIAN
I'm sorry. I didn't know. You 
didn't tell me...
EDWARD
It's alright this time. I needed to 
talk to you. But from now on, you 
don't ever answer it. Understand?
VIVIAN
Yes.
57.
EDWARD (CONT'D)
EDWARD
We're going out to dinner tonight. 
I want you to look your best. I 
don't think you have any clothes 
that will do. Go buy something a 
little more formal. Something dark 
and low cut, but tasteful. Spend 
whatever you have to. If you don't 
know what to get tell the salesgirl 
you're dining at the Rex. And have 
your hair done. We're a little 
pushed for time so I'll meet you in 
the lobby at seven forty-five. Bye.
VIVIAN
Bye.
Vivian slowly sets the phone down.
INT. DRESSING ROOM AT SAKS - DAY
Vivian is in a private dressing room as Bridget helps her 
squeeze into a tight-fitting black evening dress.
Bridget tugs upward on the sides of the strapless dress and 
shakes it a bit to get Vivian's breasts in place.
BRIDGET
There we go. Take a breath.
Vivian sucks in and Bridget zips up the back. Vivian steps over 
and looks at herself in a mirror.
BRIDGET
Your uncle will like this.
A sheepish look spreads across Vivian's face.
VIVIAN
He's not really my uncle.
Bridget shrugs.
BRIDGET
They never are.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
With her hair done up and bound with a string of imitation 
diamonds, Vivian looks elegantly sexy in her black evening 
dress. The only thing spoiling the picture as she waits in the 
lobby is the sloppy way she drags on a cigarette.
She gets more than a couple of admiring glances from male hotel 
patrons. She spots Mr. Thomas standing behind the check-in 
counter and crosses to him.
VIVIAN
(nervousl)
How do I look?
58.
Mr. Thomas smiles politely.
MR. THOMAS
Stunning. But Miss Vivian, it 
really isn't necessary for me to 
approve every outfit you wear.
Vivian puffs away on her cigarette.
VIVIAN
I'm just shaking 'cause Edward is 
taking me to this really fancy 
place. The Rex? Is that a nice 
place?
The ashes from Vivian's cigarette fall to the carpeted floor. 
Mr. Thomas winces. He slides an ashtray toward her.
VIVIAN
Oh sorry.
She stamps out her cigarette in the ashtray.
MR. THOMAS
It's a very nice restaurant.
VIVIAN
Do I look okay for it?
MR. THOMAS
You look fine. Mind what fork you 
use.
VIVIAN
(absently)
Yeah...
She spots Edward entering the lobby. He gestures for her to come 
to him.
VIVIAN
Got to go. Bye.
She quickly crosses the lobby toward him. As she does, her face 
sours as a thought comes to her.
VIVIAN
Fork?
INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT
An array of different forks is neatly lined up on the tablecloth 
next to Vivian's salad plate. She stares down at them.
EDWARD (O.S.)
I'll be happy to look into it for 
you. To be honest, I don't know if 
we've bought any of your stock.
59.
Edward sits across the table from Vivian. He selects the last 
fork on the left of the plate and begins eating the salad.
KROSS (O.S.)
Don't play any fucking games with 
me, Harris. You know damn well what 
stock you have and what you don't.
Sitting next to Vivian is James Kross, in his early 70s, a bulky 
self-made millionaire industrialist. In his youth he was foreman 
in a steel mill and during World War II pioneered the use of 
welding instead of riveting in the construction of war ships. 
But age is beginning to take its toll on him. His skin is 
unhealthy looking and his large hands sometimes tremble when he 
speaks.
He picks up the fork closest to his plate and starts to pick at 
the salad.
KROSS
I know you have control over at 
least twenty percent of the stock.
EDWARD
(calmly)
Then call the S.E.C.
Vivian glances back and forth between Kross and Edward's forks, 
trying to figure out which one she should use. Does each person 
use a different one?
KROSS
If you push me I might.
EDWARD
(politely)
Are you threatening me?
Edward notices Vivian out of the corner of his eye. She looks at 
him helplessly. He studies her curiously.
KROSS
You might have some explaining to 
do. Those guys are tired of 
parasites like you jerking them 
around.
As he talks, Edward eyes Vivian and gently taps his finger to 
the empty spot where his fork had been. Vivian gingerly picks up 
that fork from her setting. Edward winks at her. She starts to 
eat.
EDWARD
Really, Mr. Kross. I don't think we 
have anything to talk about. Maybe 
you should see my lawyer.
60.
KROSS
I came here to talk to you, not to 
eat succotash or stare at your 
girlfriend's tits. I want to talk 
business.
Edward sets down his fork, abruptly stands, and places his 
napkin next to his plate. He nods toward Vivian.
Vivian has just stuffed her mouth full of salad. She looks up at 
Edward confused.
EDWARD
Let's go, Vivian.
Vivian obediently stands, still clinging to her fork.
KROSS
Harris, wait.
Kross stands as well. Edward stares at him coolly.
KROSS
I'm sorry. That was out of line.
Edward says nothing. He starts to turn away. Kross quickly turns 
toward Vivian.
KROSS
Miss, I'm sorry about that remark. 
I apologize. It was uncalled for.
Vivian finishes chewing and swallows quickly.
VIVIAN
Oh, it's okay.
Edward looks over at Vivian with stern sympathy.
EDWARD
Are you sure, Viv?
Edward has never called her "Viv" before. Vivian stares at him, 
unsure. She doesn't know what to say; what he wants from her. 
She glances at Kross, who waits for her reply.
VIVIAN
Yeah... it's okay.
Edward picks up his napkin and slowly sits. Vivian and Kross 
sit. Edward leans toward Kross and speaks to him in a low firm 
voice.
EDWARD
I didn't have to come here. I don't 
have to talk to you. If you have 
something to say you better say it 
without threatening me or insulting 
the lady.
61.
Kross' hands tremble as he adjusts his napkin onto his lap and 
tries to calm down.
KROSS
I'm sorry. I'll get to the point. I 
think you're trying to take over my 
company. If you do get it, and if 
what I've been told about you is 
true, you'll liquidate it.
(pause)
I don't want that to happen. I 
built this company up myself. I've 
run it for forty years. We're in 
bad shape right now, but we're 
going to get through it...
As Kross talks, the waiter comes by and checks their salads. 
Edward nods that he's finished. The waiter starts collecting 
plates. Vivian, though she's finished her salad, is still 
clinging to her fork. The waiter pauses by her side. She spots 
him and sets down her fork. He whisks the plate off.
KROSS
I came here to talk to you man-to-
man to see if I can reason with 
you. What do I have to do to get 
you to call off the dogs?
EDWARD
I don't understand you.
KROSS
What would it cost to buy out your 
stock? Name your price.
EDWARD
I really don't know. But from what 
I've heard your company doesn't 
have any cash.
The waiter returns with another dish. He places a plate in front 
of each of them. As they talk, Edward subtly lifts the correct 
fork and taps it to the table. He half smiles at Vivian. Vivian, 
studiously watching his prompting, selects the correct fork. 
They both start to eat.
KROSS
Not... right now. But we're going 
to get a large contract to build 
four destroyers for the Navy. 
They're a revolutionary design and 
once we can prove it, I know we'll 
get more orders. I could give you a 
promissory note.
EDWARD
Then I'd be in a position of making 
your company a loan. That doesn't 
seem to make much sense.
62.
KROSS
We'd pay you interest. As soon as 
we get the contract...
Edward shakes his head.
EDWARD
Mr Kross, you're not going to be 
getting any Navy contracts.
KROSS
(upset)
What do you mean?
EDWARD
Just that. You're not going to be 
getting any new contracts from the 
military. I know.
KROSS
(incredulous)
You've sabotaged them?
EDWARD
You flatter me if you think I can 
tell the Pentagon what to do. But I 
do know you aren't getting the 
contract.
Kross sits quietly dazed. Much as he would like to believe it is 
a lie, he knows Edward is telling the truth.
Vivian half watches him as she eats from her plate. Edward takes 
a bite of his food and then speaks smoothly.
EDWARD
Now let me propose something to 
you. If I ever do decide to acquire 
your company, I will of course file 
the proper papers with the S.E.C. 
If that was to happen, I would 
suggest that you and the Board 
cooperate with me, rather than try 
to fight it. You couldn't stop me, 
you could only lower my profit 
margin. If you don't fight me, I 
think you'll find I can be a 
valuable friend.
Kross shakes his head, amazed at Edward's arrogance.
KROSS
You want me to recommend to the 
Board that my company be raped by a 
man like you?
EDWARD
It's not your company. It's a 
public company. 
63.
(MORE)
We both know that you can barely 
keep it going for a couple more 
years before you've completely 
drained it. It's a waste of capital 
to keep it running when it isn't 
going anywhere.
A Maitre d' comes up and stands politely next to Edward. Edward 
pauses and glances at him.
EDWARD
Yes?
The Maitre d' whispers in a low voice to Edward. Edward nods and 
the Maitre d' exits. Edward turns to Kross.
EDWARD
Now it's my turn to apologize. I'm 
afraid that I have a private call 
that I must deal with. If I may be 
excused...
Without waiting to see if he's excused, Edward stands and exits.
Vivian and Kross sit quietly. Vivian eats with her usual strong 
appetite. Kross seems to be pondering some dilemma. He stares at 
Vivian. He knows he has been beaten, but it's difficult to take 
in front of this pretty young woman.
KROSS
Your boyfriend's a real sharpie, 
little girl. A real shark. That's 
the kind of man who makes it these 
days. They smell money like blood.
Vivian stops eating. Kross continues, his voice full of emotion.
KROSS
There was a time when men got rich 
by building things. I built ships 
the size of cities! Ships that 
could rule the seas into the next 
century. Why, last year the Navy 
recommissioned a ship out of 
mothballs that I built forty years 
ago. They did it because they knew 
damn well no one could build 
anything better! We built this 
country into the greatest 
industrial power the world has ever 
known. We creamed the Japanese! We 
dwarfed the rest of the world. 
Dwarfed! This country sent men to 
the moon!
(beat)
But something happened...
He shakes his head uncertainly.
KROSS
We made mistakes, maybe. I don't 
know. We lost our way. 
64.
EDWARD (CONT'D)
(MORE)
Listened to too many Harvard fags 
telling us how to maximize profits. 
And now men like your boyfriend, 
they survive by feeding off our 
decay. They make themselves rich by 
sucking the money out of our 
shipyards. Blind to the future. 
They're destroying everything we 
built.
His eyes focus on Vivian. She is moved by his speech.
KROSS
But stay with him, little girl. You 
don't want to be on the wrong side 
of the fence when this country 
falls apart. He's going to be a 
good little meal ticket for you.
He is finished. Vivian stares at him, frozen.
Edward returns to the table and sits down.
EDWARD
My apologies again.
KROSS
Forget it. I have to go anyway.
EDWARD
At least stay for dinner.
KROSS
No. Thank you for this talk. You've 
cleared my head. I know what to do 
now.
EDWARD
Which is?
KROSS
I'm not going to pay you off. I'm 
going to fight you with every 
resource I have. Neither you nor 
any of your cronies will ever set 
foot in my shipyards. You'll burn 
in hell first.
Kross stands up.
EDWARD
Alright. If you feel that way, do 
what you have to do. And if you 
change your mind, I won't hold it 
against you later. Just tell me 
that you've changed your mind and 
I'll forget about this 
conversation.
KROSS
What are you rambling about?
65.
KROSS (CONT'D)
EDWARD
If you change your mind, come to 
me. My door will be open.
KROSS
I'm never going to speak to you 
again. I'm never going to see your 
face again. I'm just going to stop 
you. Got that?
Kross tosses his napkin into his plate and leaves.
Edward leans back in his chair, calm and relaxed. He takes a sip 
from his water glass. He smiles brightly at Vivian and then 
laughs.
Across the table Vivian stares at him unsmiling.
VIVIAN
Why are you laughing?
EDWARD
You and your fork. You were such a 
picture.
A Waiter comes up.
WAITER
Would you like the next course, 
sir?
EDWARD
(brightly)
Yes. Yes, but just for two.
INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Vivian's face is pensive as she stares out of the glass window 
down at the city lights. She quickly drains her champagne glass.
Edward stands next to her. He refills her glass with the bottle 
in one hand as he holds the wireless phone with his other.
EDWARD
(into phone)
We were right, they don't have any 
cash. The only card he had was the 
Navy contract and we know what 
happened to that. It's perfect. 
Kross is the only thing in our way 
and he's ready to cave in. Lots of 
big talk, but one push and he's 
over the edge. I could see it in 
his eyes.
Edward crosses the room and sets the champagne down on a table.
EDWARD
Well, that's your job.
66.
Vivian holds her glass in a daze. Edward, full of energy, paces 
back to her. He stares at her as he listens intently to the 
phone.
EDWARD
Do some research. The guy used to 
be a millionaire. But it's been 
downhill for over twenty years. He 
must be over leveraged. Where's he 
get his money these days? What 
banks are loaning it to him? Find 
out. We have lots of friends. It 
wouldn't take much. A couple phone 
calls.
Something catches Edward's attention. His eyes focus on Vivian's 
head. He touches the diamond string wrapped around her hair bun.
EDWARD
(holding his hand over the 
phone receiver)
Are those real?
Vivian shakes her head "no". Edward smiles.
EDWARD
They look lovely.
He leans over and gives her a kiss on the cheek. Back into the 
phone he says:
EDWARD
Now you're thinking. Get on it. 
We're going to wrap this up by 
Friday. I know it now. Talk to you 
tomorrow.
He clicks the phone off. He takes it to the table and sets it 
down. He turns back toward Vivian and slowly stalks across the 
room to her.
EDWARD
Have I even told you how very, very 
beautiful you are?
VIVIAN
(weakly)
No.
EDWARD
You are, you know. Very beautiful.
He wraps an arm around her waist and gives her a deep kiss.
EDWARD
I certainly could have done a lot 
worse for a wrong turn on Hollywood 
Boulevard.
Vivian turns away from him and quickly downs her champagne.
67.
EDWARD
Easy, lover. You're supposed to sip 
it.
Vivian crosses to the bottle on the table.
VIVIAN
(coolly)
I thought you liked me when I was 
drunk.
She fumbles a little as she picks up the bottle. She starts to 
refill the glass, spilling champagne all over. Edward pulls the 
glass and bottle away from her. He sets them down on the other 
end of the table. He takes Vivian by the wrists and turns her 
toward him. His dark eyes peer into hers.
EDWARD
Why are you running away? You've 
been acting strange all evening. 
Are you mad at me?
VIVIAN
No.
EDWARD
Then kiss me again.
Vivian throws her arms around his neck and kisses him fiercely. 
Edward's hands slide up her thighs and across her back. He runs 
them through her hair and unties the bun. Vivian shakes her hair 
out and it falls across her shoulders.
Edward gazes into her eyes. Vivian looks away. She roughly 
unzips the back of her dress and pulls it from her shoulders.
Before she can get it off, Edward grabs her by the wrists again.
EDWARD
Why are you in such a hurry?
Vivian says nothing, her eyes are on the floor.
EDWARD
Am I ugly to you? Am I fat and 
disgusting? Do I smell bad?
VIVIAN
(softly)
No.
EDWARD
People have been so bold as to tell 
me I'm somewhat attractive. Aren't 
I to you?
VIVIAN
You're very... handsome.
68.
EDWARD
Then why are you in such a rush to 
get it over with? We have all 
night. Is it really such a chore? 
Are you so jaded that you never 
enjoy making love?
Vivian pulls away and turns her back on him.
VIVIAN
(firmly)
Not with customers.
EDWARD
Why not? I think I've been pretty 
good to you the last few days. 
Haven't I treated you well?
Vivian stands silently for a moment.
VIVIAN
(softly)
...Yes.
EDWARD
I can't hear you.
Edward takes her by the shoulder and spins her around. Her eyes 
are full of tears.
VIVIAN
Yes!
EDWARD
Why are you crying?
Vivian says nothing. Edward shakes her gently.
EDWARD
Answer me.
VIVIAN
It's your fucking champagne. You 
got me all weird inside. I drank 
too much.
EDWARD
(gently)
Tell me why you're crying.
VIVIAN
Leave me alone!
(desperately)
What do you want from me?!
EDWARD
My money's worth.
Another tears slides from Vivian's eyes.
69.
VIVIAN
I've given it to you.
EDWARD
No you haven't. I thought I had you 
for a week, but you've only given me 
a tiny part of yourself. The rest you 
keep from me. You try to hide it. But 
back there in a dark corner of your 
eyes I can see it. Hidden away in the 
shadows. And every time I see it I 
wonder what it is, and why you are so 
determined to keep it from me. It 
makes me want you more and more. Let 
me have it. Let me see it for a few 
days. I promise I won't keep it.
Edward slowly takes her into his arms.
VIVIAN
I don't know what you're saying. 
You don't make any sense. Just let 
me go, please. Let me go.
Edward kisses her gently. Vivian is limp in his arms, tears 
rolling down her neck.
EDWARD
Do you want me to make love to you?
Vivian looks into his eyes.
VIVIAN
...Yes...
EDWARD
There. That's all I wanted.
Vivian's eyes focus upon him. She leans up and with trembling 
lips she kisses his cheek.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Vivian, dressed in a white silk nightgown, sits on the carpet in 
the middle of the living room. Her head is down and her hair is 
a tangled mess that covers her eyes.
Edward, dressed in his usual business suit, comes from the 
bedroom, struggling with his tie. He sees Vivian sitting limply 
on the floor.
EDWARD
What are you doing?
VIVIAN
Just sitt'n'.
70.
EDWARD
Why don't you sit on the couch, or 
go back to bed? Don't you feel 
alright?
VIVIAN
I've got a little headache.
EDWARD
No wonder, the way you were 
drinking last night. You want to do 
my tie?
VIVIAN
Yes.
She pulls herself off the floor and walks to him. She bites her 
lip as she deftly ties it into a neat knot. Edward glances at 
his reflection in the plate windows to see if it is alright.
EDWARD
Hmmm. Cindy always ties it so the 
emblem is right in the center of 
the knot.
VIVIAN
Oh.
She reaches for him to try to re-tie it.
EDWARD
No, that's alright. I don't have 
time. This will do.
Edward gives her a warm kiss. She doesn't return it. Her eyes 
are glassy.
EDWARD
I hope you feel better. I'll be 
gone all day. Maybe we'll have 
dinner someplace nice tonight.
VIVIAN
(hopefully)
I'd like that.
Edward smiles at her and walks away. He exits up the stairs. 
Vivian watches him go.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
Vivian, wearing her pink dress, strolls by shops in the hotel 
lobby, half-heartedly window-shopping. She keeps glancing around 
the lobby as if waiting for someone.
She spots Mr. Thomas coming out of a back room. She crosses the 
lobby and heads for him.
71.
Mr. Thomas spots Vivian and half smiles. He isn't quite sure 
what he thinks about her. Her presence in his hotel makes him 
nervous, and yet he secretly enjoys her company.
VIVIAN
(cheerfully)
Hi.
MR. THOMAS
Miss Vivian.
VIVIAN
I've got to talk to you. Boy, did 
you mix me up last night with that 
line about the fork. I think I made 
a fool of myself.
MR. THOMAS
(honestly concerned)
How?
VIVIAN
Oh, I didn't know which fork to use 
so I kept holding off and everyone 
used different ones and Edward 
laughed at me.
MR. THOMAS
Oh, I'm sorry. It really isn't that 
difficult.
VIVIAN
Well then show me. Edward might 
take me to dinner tonight and I 
don't want to look like a dummy 
again.
Mr. Thomas looks around the lobby uncomfortably.
MR. THOMAS
Well, I'm on duty right now. Just 
use the one on the left.
VIVIAN
No, you got to show me the whole 
thing. The whole dinner thing. From 
the top. You got me into this mess.
MR. THOMAS
(amused)
I...? How am I responsible?
VIVIAN
Because if you hadn't told me, I 
wouldn't have even thought about 
it. Now I'm all jittery.
Mr. Thomas smiles and glances around the lobby again. Everything 
seems quiet enough. Why not?
72.
MR. THOMAS
Alright, come with me, young lady. 
In fifteen minutes I can teach you 
everything you need to know to dine 
with the queen.
INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY
Mr. Thomas' desk is laid out with two opposing sets of 
tableware. He shows Vivian the correct piece from his side and 
she mirrors his actions from the other.
MR. THOMAS
And as you pick up the knife you 
shift your fork to the left hand.
Vivian does this.
VIVIAN
Hey, I already knew that one. I 
always do that.
MR. THOMAS
You had good parents.
VIVIAN
But the other guy ate like this.
Vivian switches the fork and knife.
MR. THOMAS
Well, he was either European or 
badly brought up.
VIVIAN
No, he was a rich guy, too. I could 
tell.
MR. THOMAS
That doesn't mean a thing. Some of 
the richest people I've met have 
the worst manners. Of course, Mr. 
Harris, being of old money, knows 
his way around a table.
VIVIAN
What's old money?
MR. THOMAS
That means he has inherited his 
money down a long family line. It 
used to be fashionable to look down 
upon people who had become rich 
through their own labor.
(shrugging)
In fact, it seems to be in fashion 
again. But let's continue with our 
lesson. 
73.
(MORE)
Most restaurants don't even lay out 
their silver correctly, so if they 
don't it isn't your fault if you 
pick up the wrong one. Spoons...
INT. BROKAGE HOUSE - DAY
Vance is punching numbers into a computer terminal as Edward and 
William watch the display.
VANCE
The word's on the street. Stock's 
at ten and a quarter.
Edward smiles.
EDWARD
Flight of fancy. Let's offer eight. 
That should bring them back down to 
earth. Then we'll raise it to nine 
and close the deal.
WILLIAM
I'll work on the papers.
VANCE
So we're filing?
EDWARD
Yes, time to jump out of the 
closet.
INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY
Edward and William are lounging together at the end of a long 
meeting table. A lovely young Secretary comes in and serves them 
coffee from a tray.
SECRETARY
How do you like it, Mr. Reaves?
WILLIAM
(suggestively)
Any way I can get it, angel.
The Secretary forces herself to smile politely.
SECRETARY
Cream or sugar?
WILLIAM
Both.
EDWARD
Black.
The Secretary pours the coffee into two cups and saucers and 
lays them nearly on the table. She picks up the tray and exits. 
William watches her go.
Edward takes a sip of his coffee.
74.
MR. THOMAS (CONT'D)
EDWARD
So, tell me about Kross.
William waits until the Secretary has closed the door and then 
picks up his coffee.
WILLIAM
You're right, as usual. Completely 
mortgaged down to his grandson's 
scholarship funds. Best of all, 
he's applying for another loan.
EDWARD
Bank we know?
WILLIAM
Oh yeah.
EDWARD
Need me to call anyone?
WILLIAM
Nope. It's all handled. Nice and 
quiet. You can forget all about it.
EDWARD
(sipping his coffee)
I will.
Edward changes the subject.
EDWARD
So why don't we go to dinner 
tonight? You can leer at this girl 
I have for the week.
WILLIAM
Is this the one whose honor you 
defended from Kross?
EDWARD
(laughing)
Yes. You'll like her. Just your 
type. A real tramp.
INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Edward, William, and Vivian are dining at another elegant 
restaurant. Vivian is decked out in her black low-cut dress. 
William stares at her cleavage as she eats daintily, holding her 
silverware carefully in her hands.
EDWARD
(to Vivian)
Tell Bill what you said to me, that 
first night.
(to William)
It was something like, "if you're 
looking for romance you were 
cruising down the wrong street. 
75.
(MORE)
But if you want to fuck, you've 
found the best..."
(to Vivian)
Was that how it went?
VIVIAN
(uncomfortably)
Yeah, I think so.
William stares at Vivian fixedly.
WILLIAM
You look very familiar to me. 
Haven't I seen you before?
Vivian shakes her head no.
WILLIAM
You work for Robert's agency, don't 
you?
VIVIAN
No.
WILLIAM
Oh.
(to Edward)
I thought that's where you got your 
girls.
EDWARD
You must be joking. I'm not going 
to pay a fortune for a high-class 
gold digger to leech off me. Last 
time I called them, I ended up 
spending ten grand for a skinny 
little thing that kept pressuring 
me to buy her jewels. I found 
Vivian on Hollywood Boulevard and 
she's charging me a third of that. 
And she's happy to get it, aren't 
you?
Vivian meekly nods. She isn't enjoying the conversation.
WILLIAM
Jesus, Edward, you're the only 
billionaire I know who would go 
tramping around Hollywood looking 
for a bargain streetwalker. Just 
because you got one bad girl 
doesn't mean you should write off 
the whole agency. When you get a 
girl from Robert's you're paying 
for discretion.
EDWARD
What do I need discretion for? I'm 
divorced. And I don't need a girl 
who speaks French better than I do. 
Vivian has been an absolute doll. 
76.
EDWARD (CONT'D)
(MORE)
I had to buy her a few things so 
that she'd be presentable, but I'm 
still going to save money in the 
long run.
William shakes his head. He glances over at Vivian.
WILLIAM
Can you believe the way this guy 
talks? Do you know how much he's 
worth?
Vivian doesn't answer. She lowers her eyes and concentrates on 
her food.
EDWARD
Why are you always pushing Robert's 
on me, Bill? You own a piece of 
that?
WILLIAM
(irritated)
No. It's just a nice agency and I 
like to keep my clients happy. But 
if you can find true love in 
Hollywood, for a great mark down, 
that's okay by me.
Edward leans over to William.
EDWARD
She's a real tiger in bed.
WILLIAM
(eying her)
I'll bet she is.
Edward eats. William watches Vivian push the food around on her 
plate. He seems bothered by something.
EDWARD
(amused)
What are you thinking about, Bill?
WILLIAM
(looking away)
Nothing.
EDWARD
You want her? I don't mind. You 
want to try her?
WILLIAM
Jesus, Edward, don't be so tacky. I 
can rent my own girls.
EDWARD
I can read you like a freeway sign.
77.
EDWARD (CONT'D)
WILLIAM
(tensely)
I'm not interested.
EDWARD
Go ahead. Vivian doesn't care. 
She's used to six guys a night. 
Just be sure you wear a condom. 
She's careful about that.
WILLIAM
Thanks, Ed. That really turns me 
on. Now can we just drop it? Don't 
we have anything else to talk 
about?
Edward leans back in his chair and smiles smugly.
EDWARD
North American Steel.
William glares at Edward and then laughs, relaxing at last.
WILLIAM
No. No way. You'll never get it. 
Not a prayer.
EDWARD
Why not?
Vivian stares at Edward expressionlessly.
INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
Edward and Vivian come into the room. Edward switches on a 
light. Vivian walks down the steps into the living room. Her 
face is rigid; her eyes are focused on the floor.
Edward follows after her.
EDWARD
My, you're quiet again. You haven't 
said a word to me since we left the 
restaurant. I kind of like it, but...
As Edward touches her shoulder Vivian suddenly spins and 
explodes with anger, pounding him with closed fists.
VIVIAN
You fucker! You fucking bastard!
Vivian frantically pounds away at Edward, not so much to hurt 
him, but as if purging herself of emotion.
Edward pulls back for a moment and then forcefully grabs her 
arms and throws her onto the couch.
EDWARD
Have you lost your mind?!
78.
Vivian jumps up and runs at Edward. Edward grabs her and throws 
her down onto the couch. Before she can get up again Edward 
pushes her back down. Tears well up in Vivian's eyes as she 
yells at him.
VIVIAN
You fucking asshole. I can't 
believe what a shit you are!
EDWARD
Would you please tell me what 
you're mad about?
VIVIAN
I'm not a fucking piece of meat for 
you to offer to your friends!
Edward is taken aback. He adopts a gentler tone. Vivian sits on 
the couch, seething with rage.
EDWARD
Alright. Just calm down.
VIVIAN
I almost picked up that fucking 
table and smashed it in your 
fucking face. I almost did it!
EDWARD
I appreciate your self-control.
VIVIAN
I fucking beat the shit out of a pimp 
who tried to force me into his 
stable. I could beat the shit out of 
you! I almost started screaming in 
the restaurant I was so mad. I would 
have punched you in the face and 
walked out of there but... but...
Vivian's voice cools to an icy calm.
VIVIAN
...I wanted my money.
EDWARD
I'm sorry. It never even occurred 
to me that you would mind. 
Honestly.
VIVIAN
(exploding)
I WANT MY FUCKING MONEY! I'm 
getting out of here! I don't want 
anything to do with you!
EDWARD
(firmly)
Lower your voice.
79.
VIVIAN
Give me my money.
EDWARD
Can we talk about this? Can you 
just try to calm down?
VIVIAN
I'm going crazy 'cause you won't 
let me get high. I'm bored out of 
my fucking mind all day and 
whenever I see you, you treat me 
like shit! You don't like the way I 
eat. I never tie your tie right. I 
don't drink enough and then I drink 
too much. You're always shitting on 
me!
A tear falls from Vivian's eyes. Edward shakes his head at her, 
incredulous.
EDWARD
I'm sorry. I thought I was treating 
you pretty nicely.
VIVIAN
I've fucked stinking old men who 
made me want to puke, but I've 
never had anyone make me feel as 
dirty as you do! You make me feel 
dirty inside.
EDWARD
I... I wasn't even serious. It was 
just a joke. I was razzing Bill 
because he runs this call girl 
service. We tease each other like 
that. It's quite juvenile. But I 
didn't think you'd mind my 
saying... I mean it's not as if 
you're from a convent.
VIVIAN
YOU DON'T OWN ME! I say when! I say 
who! I say how much! If I make a 
deal with you it's between me and 
you and if he wants to FUCK ME TOO 
then he can ask me and I'll tell 
him how much!
EDWARD
Of course. You're right. I'm sorry.
VIVIAN
I don't fuck anyone who sticks 
their dick out at me. I fuck who I 
want! I say how much! I run my 
life! You don't run my life!
80.
EDWARD
Vivian, I'm very sorry. You're 
absolutely right. That was an 
idiotic and insensitive thing I 
did. I can tell that you have a lot 
of pride and I should have known 
that that would hurt you.
Vivian jumps to her feet.
VIVIAN
It didn't hurt me! It doesn't hurt 
you when someone pisses on you! It 
just pisses you off!
Edward's face sours. She is trying his patience.
EDWARD
Alright. I've apologized. I've said 
I'm sorry. Now if you want to take 
what you've earned so far and walk 
out of here, I'll understand.
Vivian doesn't say anything.
EDWARD
Do you want me to call a cab?
Vivian is still silent.
EDWARD
Do you?
VIVIAN
I don't know.
EDWARD
Then think about it. But we're 
going to get past this. I've 
apologized already. I've heard what 
you have to say, you're right and 
it won't happen again. But if you 
can't get past it then you should 
leave, because I'm only going to be 
here a couple more days and I'm not 
going to spend it fighting with 
you. Understand?
VIVIAN
(bitterly)
Fuck off.
EDWARD
Alright. I'll call a cab. If you 
want the clothes, pack them up.
Vivian stands frozen for a moment. Suddenly she spins and 
marches into the bedroom.
81.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light of 
the bedroom. As she does she starts crying. With each item of 
clothing the tears come down harder. Finally she is crying so 
hard she can't breathe. She lets the clothes fall from her arms 
and starts to shake uncontrollably.
Edward appears at the doorway. His face is genuinely concerned.
Vivian sobs in fits, gasping for air.
EDWARD
(tenderly)
I'm sorry. I really am sorry.
Vivian finally manages to breathe again. She stands limply. Her 
face is smeared black with mascara.
VIVIAN
You...
(barely audible)
...hurt me.
Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders. She 
touches his hand.
INT. BATHTUB - NIGHT
Edward and Vivian are taking a bath together. It isn't a bubble 
bath. Edward wipes the black mascara from Vivian's eyes with his 
wet hands.
EDWARD
I've been a fiendish cad, and I'll 
make it up to you.
VIVIAN
I got so crazy. I'm not like that. 
I don't know why I got so crazy.
EDWARD
(exaggerating his Harvard 
accent)
Because I was a boor, a clod, an 
oaf, a cretin, a dunce, a putz, a 
shmuck...
He washes the black from his hands and caresses her cheeks again 
with warm water.
EDWARD
...but I shall make amends as only 
a Harris can.
He runs his little finger across he eyebrows and down her nose.
EDWARD
I shall give you an experience that 
will last a lifetime.
82.
Vivian smiles.
VIVIAN
Yeah, sure. You're good, lover, but 
not that good.
EDWARD
Vivian, your mind is always in the 
gutter. Mine's only there 
frequently. I speak not of the 
lower forms of pleasure, but of 
high art.
VIVIAN
What?
EDWARD
I'm going to take you to the opera.
EXT. FANCY CLOTHING STORE ON RODEO DRIVE - DAY
Edward is holding Vivian by the hand as they stand in front of a 
display window. Inside the window is a stunning red sequined 
dress.
EDWARD
That's it. That's what you're 
wearing tonight.
Vivian's eyes light up like a child on Christmas morning.
INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY
Edward sits on a comfortable chair sipping tea as he waits by 
the dressing room. A prim, well-dressed Saleswoman stands at 
attention by his side.
Vivian comes out of the dressing room wearing the red dress. She 
looks beautiful in it. Her face is aglow with pleasure as she 
admires herself in the mirror. The Saleswoman walks over to her 
and checks the fit.
SALESWOMAN
It'll need a couple alterations to 
fit right in the bust. We can do 
them here.
EDWARD
We need them done now. I'm taking 
her to Aida in San Francisco 
tonight.
The Saleswoman purrs in Vivian's ear.
SALESWOMAN
Oh, you're so lucky. It's supposed 
to be fabulous.
83.
INT. MERCEDES - DAY
Edward is talking on his car phone. Vivian sits happily next to 
him, admiring her new dress.
EDWARD
(into the phone)
Bill, Bill, stop panicking. I'll 
read the contracts on the plane. 
Just have the brokerage arrange the 
flights for me. Kross isn't going 
anywhere. It's not like I'm going 
to help anything by watching the 
stock go down today. Have it ready 
for me. I'll make a couple more 
stops and be there in an hour or 
two. 'Bye.
Vivian looks over at Edward, still reeling from all the 
attention he is giving her.
VIVIAN
Are you sure this is alright? I 
don't want you to hurt your 
business.
Edward smiles amusedly.
EDWARD
My empire may crumble through 
neglect, but it's worth it. I've 
been meaning to see Aida before it 
closes and now I have a good 
excuse. But you must be freezing in 
that skimpy thing.
VIVIAN
I'm okay.
EDWARD
No, no. You're bound to get 
pneumonia if we don't do something.
INT. FURRIER - DAY
Vivian stands wrapped up in a gray mink coat. She rubs the fur 
against her cheek in ecstasy. Edward sits near her, watching.
VIVIAN
It's so soft.
A handsome young Salesman is standing by her side, his arms 
filled with other coats. He looks at Edward for approval.
EDWARD
Nice, but not what I had in mind. 
We're only going to rent it for a 
few days, so we might as well get 
something really special.
84.
SALESMAN
I have just the thing.
He exits into the other room. Vivian looks at Edward pleadingly.
VIVIAN
I like this one.
EDWARD
Vivian, trust me, I know furs. I'm 
going to find you one that will 
give you multiple orgasms.
The Salesman comes out carrying a long, stark white fur coat. 
Vivian's eyes widen. The Salesman hands it to Edward.
SALESMAN
Baby seal, very rare. You can't get 
them anywhere any more. I normally 
wouldn't even consider renting it, but 
for you, Mr. Harris...
Edward nods. He stands up and walks to Vivian's side. The 
Salesman helps Vivian out of the mink and steps back. Edward 
slides the coat over Vivian's arms. He wraps it around her body 
and gives her a kiss. Vivian melts.
VIVIAN
(whispering in Edward's 
ear)
I think I'm coming.
SALESMAN
(loudly)
Of course, if you do decide to 
purchase it later, I'll deduct the 
rental fees from the total cost.
Edward glances at the Salesman sideways.
EDWARD
Don't get your hopes up, Frank. 
We're just renting it for the 
opera.
INT. SHOE STORE - DAY
Another Salesman is fitting Vivian with a pair of red high heel 
shoes. Edward sits next to her. He leans over and whispers in 
her ear.
EDWARD
Feel like Cinderella yet?
Vivian nods happily.
INT. BROKERAGE - NIGHT
Edward, dashing in a tuxedo, escorts Vivian by the hand down a 
long hallway as William trails after them. 
85.
Vivian, balancing on high heels, is having trouble keeping up 
with him on the slippery marble floors.
WILLIAM
Please, at least think about it. 
It's a gold mine. You're the one 
who thought it up.
EDWARD
Bill, I don't want to get in the 
toxic waste business. What a 
nightmare! I just want to sell the 
rights to the highest bidder. Let 
them do the dirty work. Those 
processing licenses must be worth a 
fortune.
WILLIAM
But not half as much as if we use 
them ourselves.
Edward stops suddenly and turns toward William. Vivian skids and 
almost falls; she grabs Edward's shoulder for balance. Edward, 
ignoring her, looks down at William like a teacher lecturing a 
slow student.
EDWARD
Bill. Cash, leverage, acquire. 
Cash, leverage, acquire. Cash, 
leverage, acquire. Got it?
WILLIAM
Okay, okay. I got it.
Edward slaps William on the shoulder and drags Vivian off.
WILLIAM
Enjoy the opera! Read the 
contracts!
EXT. HELIPORT - DAY
Vivian and Edward come out onto the roof and make their way to a 
waiting helicopter.
Once they are inside, the helicopter takes off.
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
Vivian looks out the window as the chopper flies over the city. 
She squeezes Edward's hand.
VIVIAN
It's like a dream.
Edward smiles absently as he reads through some papers.
EXT. HELIPORT AT BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY
Edward and Vivian climb out of the helicopter and make their way 
from the landing pad.
86.
A Pilot in a leather jacket and dark sunglasses greets them.
PILOT
Mr. Harris?
EDWARD
Yes.
PILOT
Your plane is ready to go, sir.
EXT. HELIPORT AT BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY
A small corporate jet takes off down the landing strip.
INT. JET - DAY
Edward and Vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet. 
It is a comfortable room featuring a long couch that curves 
across two walls, a small bar, and a built-in television and 
stereo. Edward is sorting through a pile of contracts. Vivian is 
looking at herself in a small mirror. He hair is wild and loose 
from the helicopter.
VIVIAN
Good thing I didn't have my hair 
done.
EDWARD
Oh, I should have warned you. Cindy 
won't even let me get her near a 
helicopter.
VIVIAN
I can fix it.
EDWARD
Good, now be quiet while I read 
these.
Vivian smiles wickedly and fluffs her hair up. She takes her fur 
off and lays it down on the floor. She walks over to Edward and 
slides into his lap. She starts to kiss his neck.
Edward, grinning, pushes her away gently.
EDWARD
Go away.
Vivian, undaunted, slides the straps of her dress off her 
shoulders. She stands and it falls to the floor. Wearing only a 
pair of red panties, she lies down on the fur coat.
EDWARD
What are you doing?
Vivian gives Edward her finest come-hither look.
VIVIAN
Being quiet.
87.
Edward sets down his papers.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SUNSET
The sun is just beginning to set as the jet makes a slow pass 
over the city and heads for the airport.
INT. JET - SUNSET
Vivian, naked, stares out the window at the city lights 
twinkling below. Her eyes are full of wonder.
VIVIAN
I can see the bridge. It's all lit 
up. It's so beautiful.
Edward is reading a contract. Without glancing up he speaks to 
her.
EDWARD
You'd better put on your clothes, 
now. I don't want to give the pilot 
a thrill.
Vivian reaches down and picks up her red dress.
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco 
Opera House. The driver walks around back and opens the 
passenger door. Edward emerges and helps the fur-wrapped Vivian 
out.
They walk toward the Opera House past a beautifully lit fountain 
with several graceful statues in its center. Edward has his hand 
on Vivian's elbow as they talk.
EDWARD
Some people say that opera is a 
cultivated taste -- that's why 
everyone prefers movies -- but I 
don't believe that. It's something 
you're born to. But I don't mean 
that in an elitist sense. High 
born, low born, you can always tell 
when someone goes to the opera for 
the first time. Some love it, some 
hate it. Those who love it will 
always love it; those who hate it 
might force themselves to 
appreciate it, but they'll never 
love it. Maybe there's an opera 
gene in a person's DNA. It'll be 
interesting to see how you react.
VIVIAN
Even if I hate it, I'm glad you 
took me.
88.
EDWARD
So am I.
INT. OPERA LOBBY - NIGHT
A small crowd of well-dressed people move through the lobby 
toward the theater. Vivian admires the pretty dresses and things 
around her.
INT. THEATER - NIGHT
Edward and Vivian sit front row center on the first balcony. 
They hold programs while they wait for the curtain. Vivian leans 
over to Edward and speaks in a low voice.
VIVIAN
If it's in Italian, how will I know 
what they're saying?
EDWARD
I'll whisper some of the main parts 
of the story for you. But you'll be 
surprised at how much you'll 
understand by the way they sing. 
The music conveys their emotions 
more powerfully than any words.
The orchestra begins.
MONTAGE OF OPERA
When the lights dim and the opera is performed, we do not shift 
to the stage but rather stay on Vivian.
As the music builds and the changing stage lights dance across 
her face we see the opera unfold only through her eyes. As we 
DISSOLVE from close-up to close-up, Edward occasionally leans 
over and whispers intimately into her ear.
EDWARD
Radames is desperately in love with 
Aida, a mere slave. Yet he is 
forced to marry Amneris, the King's 
daughter.
The music continues. Vivian's face focuses intensely on the 
stage, as if a new world is being revealed to her. Edward leans 
toward her ear.
EDWARD
Here he tells Aida how much he 
loves her but...
Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth. She nods, 
eyes fixed on the stage. She understands what is happening.
As Vivian's hand slowly lowers, Edward glances at her, pleased. 
He holds onto her hand and gently strokes her fingers.
89.
Vivian concentrates on what is happening. The music is reaching 
its tragic climax. The emotions building inside Vivian swell. As 
the opera ends, she is profoundly moved. A single tear rolls 
down her cheek.
INT. STAIRCASE / OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT
Vivian and Edward stand at the top of an elegant staircase 
leading down from the balcony. Vivian is slightly swaying as if 
weak. Edward has a firm arm around her shoulder.
EDWARD
Are you alright? Can you make it 
down the stairs?
VIVIAN
I just stood up too fast. My head 
is spinning. The blood all went to 
my legs. Just a second.
Edward holds her tightly as other patrons move past them and 
down the stairs. Edward smiles smugly at her.
EDWARD
You liked the opera, didn't you?
Vivian nods.
VIVIAN
Yeah. It was... I liked it so much. 
It... was sad.
As she thinks about it, she feels the urge to cry again. She 
fights it.
VIVIAN
I'm okay now.
INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
Vivian is lying across the lounge couch with her head on 
Edward's lap. Edward strokes her hair. Tears are streaming from 
her eyes.
EDWARD
You're such an emotional little 
creature.
VIVIAN
(defensively)
It was sad.
EDWARD
I know. But I took you to make you 
happy, not to make you cry.
VIVIAN
I'm happy. Just sad happy is all.
90.
EDWARD
You've been crying for an hour.
Vivian wipes her eyes.
VIVIAN
I just... I'm kinda used to smoking 
whenever I get sad, you know? It 
keeps me feeling good. I'm not used 
to being off it.
EDWARD
I'm sorry if that's been tough on 
you.
VIVIAN
No, no. It's okay. It's just like 
I'm feeling all sorts of strange 
things. It's kinda nice in a way. I 
just have trouble handling it 
sometimes.
EDWARD
Well, the day after tomorrow I'm 
off to New York and you can do 
whatever you want. And you'll have 
some money to do it with.
VIVIAN
Yeah.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Edward is sound asleep. Vivian is staring off into the darkness. 
She can't sleep.
She slowly crawls out of bed. She is wearing a pink teddy. 
Edward stirs. He blinks his eyes.
EDWARD
What's the matter?
VIVIAN
Noth'n'. Just can't sleep.
EDWARD
Oh.
VIVIAN
Can I get some champagne? Maybe 
it'll help me sleep.
EDWARD
Sure. Let me call ...
He pulls himself up with difficulty.
VIVIAN
No, no. I can call. You sleep. I'm 
alright. Really.
91.
Edward lies back down.
EDWARD
(sleepily)
Okay. Order whatever you want.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Vivian sits alone on the living room floor staring out the 
windows into the city. She is dressed in her pink teddy with the 
white fur wrapped around her shoulders. She sips straight from 
the bottle of champagne.
She hums a tune from the opera.
She takes a long drink and arranges the bottom of the fur over 
her legs for warmth.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Edward is dressed in his robe talking on the phone as he looks 
over the morning breakfast on the dining table.
EDWARD
Jesus that was fast. What did you 
do, put a horse head in his bed?
INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - MORNING
A Secretary hands William a cup of coffee. He takes a sip.
WILLIAM
Very funny. I barely did anything. 
The old coot must be more desperate 
than either of us thought. He said 
he wouldn't talk to me about 
specifics until after our thirty-
day filing period. But he wants to 
talk to you. Get assurances that 
you're both on the same side or 
something. Maybe get you to call 
off the dogs, i.e., me.
He takes another sip of his coffee. He waves the Secretary off. 
She exits.
WILLIAM
Anyhow, I told him that I might be 
able to arrange for you to see him 
this morning at your hotel room. 
What I'd like you to do is butter 
him up and then drag him here so I 
can grill him.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Edward is sipping orange juice.
EDWARD
You're such a sneaky fucker.
92.
WILLIAM
The guy's pathetic. All you have to 
do is take him by the hand and 
bring him over. If we could just 
get him to tell us the story on the 
Navy repair commitments it would be 
worth it.
Edward glances at his watch.
EDWARD
Alright. Tell him ten-thirty.
WILLIAM
He'll be there.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Vivian is passed out on the bed. Edward comes in and undoes his 
robe. He starts to put on a suit.
EDWARD
Wake up, sleeping beauty.
Vivian stirs. She blinks and looks at Edward with sleepy red 
eyes.
VIVIAN
What?
EDWARD
Put on some clothes. We're going to 
have a guest.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Vivian, wearing her yellow dress, is tying Edward's tie for him.
EDWARD
You sure you don't mind? I wouldn't 
want you to get mad at me again.
VIVIAN
No, it's okay. I didn't mean it. I 
like tying it.
She finishes. Edward checks it in the mirror.
EDWARD
Pattern in the center. Perfect. 
That's lovely.
He gives her a peck on the cheek. We hear the doorbell ring from 
the living room.
EDWARD
Well, here we go.
93.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Vivian stands near the bedroom as Edward opens the front door. 
Mr. Kross slowly enters. He looks old and tired. The shake hands 
and Edward closes the door behind him.
EDWARD
Mr. Kross.
KROSS
Mr. Harris.
Edward leads him down the stairs.
EDWARD
Have a seat.
KROSS
I can't stay very long.
Kross notices Vivian standing across the room. He seems 
surprised to see her. Surprised and bothered. He nods to her.
KROSS
Young lady.
VIVIAN
Hi.
They both seem uncomfortable in each other's presence. Like 
former lovers who run into each other by surprise in public. 
Kross immediately turns his eyes away from her. He looks at 
Edward.
KROSS
I'll get to the point. As I said 
earlier today to your lawyer, I've 
reconsidered my position on your 
expected acquisition offer. After 
the filing period is over, I'll 
recommend to the board that we 
accept your bid.
EDWARD
Excellent. I'm sure that will be 
the best for everyone.
KROSS
And I wanted to apologize for...
EDWARD
There is nothing for you to 
apologize for. It's just business.
Kross's hands are trembling. He glances nervously at Vivian and 
then back at Edward.
KROSS
Yes. Business.
94.
Vivian is disturbed watching this broken man. She backs away 
into the bedroom and disappears.
KROSS
That's all. I just wanted to tell 
you my decision in person.
EDWARD
I appreciate that. And I'm sure 
things will go well for you.
KROSS
Thank you. I'd better be going.
EDWARD
Perhaps you could do me one favor, 
though. If you could take an hour 
to accompany me down to my 
brokerage and have a brief talk 
with my lawyer. Just answer a 
couple questions.
KROSS
I don't think that's quite proper 
at this time. Maybe after the 
filing period.
EDWARD
Let me be completely up front with 
you, Mr. Kross. We're preparing our 
bid now. That bid is based on our 
speculation of the corporation's net 
worth. The more we know the higher 
our bid can be. And since you do own 
a large block of shares...
KROSS
...It's in my best interest to 
cooperate.
EDWARD
We might even be able to strike a 
special deal with you on your 
particular block of shares.
Kross looks at Edward with a weak smile.
KROSS
And if I throw myself on my sword, 
you promise to take care of my 
family.
Edward stares at Kross evenly.
EDWARD
It doesn't have to be that way.
KROSS
Alright. I'll answer your 
questions. Whatever you want.
95.
EDWARD
Good.
(turning)
Vivian...
Edward notices for the first time that Vivian has left the room.
EDWARD
Just one second.
He heads to the bedroom.
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
Vivian is sitting on the bed as Edward comes in. He closes the 
door behind him.
EDWARD
Why'd you run off?
Vivian stares at her feet.
VIVIAN
Just... no reason.
EDWARD
Very well. I'm going to be gone all 
day. I don't think I'll be back in 
time for dinner so go ahead and 
eat. Alright?
Vivian looks up at Edward.
VIVIAN
What did you do to him?
EDWARD
What do you mean?
VIVIAN
Why is he afraid of you? What did 
you do to him?
Edward is silent for a long while. He doesn't like this question.
EDWARD
I don't think you need to worry 
about things like that.
VIVIAN
(almost to herself)
Last time I saw him he was so 
strong. Now he's so scared.
EDWARD
(firmly)
The man made a business decision. 
That's all. I make business 
decisions; you make business 
decisions. 
96.
(MORE)
Nobody does anything unless it's in 
his own best interest.
Vivian stares at her feet and says nothing. Edward watches her. 
He turns and leaves.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Edward crosses the living room to Kross.
EDWARD
Everything's fine. Let's go.
EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - DAY
It's a cold cloudy day. Vivian stands in front of the hotel in 
her mink coat, smoking a cigarette. She watches the cars passing 
by, thinking.
An old yellow Mustang passes. She takes a last drag and tosses 
her cigarette butt into the gutter.
She turns and goes back into the hotel.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
Vivian walks up to the front desk and addresses the Desk Clerk.
VIVIAN
Is there a phone I can use? I want 
to call a cab.
DESK CLERK
You may use this phone.
He pulls a phone from under the desk.
Mr. Thomas enters from the back door. He smiles at Vivian.
MR. THOMAS
Miss Vivian.
VIVIAN
Hi. What's the number of a cab 
company?
MR. THOMAS
Where are you going?
VIVIAN
Ummm... Hollywood like. I need to 
get some medicine. You know, for 
headaches.
MR. THOMAS
Why don't you use one of the 
hotel's limousines?
VIVIAN
Limo?
97.
EDWARD (CONT'D)
MR. THOMAS
Of course. A small perk for the 
guests in our better rooms.
Vivian thinks about that for a moment. She kind of likes the 
idea, but it also makes her nervous.
VIVIAN
Ummm... I don't want Edward to know 
I'm leaving. He... I just don't 
want...
MR. THOMAS
Discretion is our middle name here 
at the Beverly Wilshire.
EXT. LIMO - DAY
A long black limo drives into Hollywood.
INT. LIMO - DAY
Vivian sits alone in the back of the limo, enjoying the ride. 
There is a phone and a tiny television set and a small stereo 
system. She examines each carefully and plays with the knobs.
LIMO DRIVER (O.S.) 
(from a small speaker)
Is this the street, Ma'am?
Vivian presses the intercom button.
VIVIAN
Yes. 1312. It's a big apartment 
building.
EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
The limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment 
building on a dirty Hollywood side street.
The Limo Driver, a large Latino man, steps out of the car and 
walks around to the passenger door. As he does he surveys the 
surroundings uncomfortably. This is a rough neighborhood.
He opens the door. Vivian steps out, fur and all.
LIMO DRIVER
Are you sure this is the right 
place, Ma'am?
VIVIAN
Yeah.
LIMO DRIVER
Maybe I should go with you. This 
doesn't look like a good place for 
a lady to be alone.
98.
Vivian is suddenly aware of how her appearance has changed. She 
wraps the fur around herself a little nervously.
VIVIAN
I'll be okay. I'll just be a 
second.
LIMO DRIVER
You sure, Ma'am?
VIVIAN
Yeah.
She hurries up the steps to the apartment building. The Limo 
Driver unhappily watches her go.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Vivian's bright new shoes and white fur traverse the grimy dark 
carpeted hallways. Cockroaches scurry along the edges of the 
walls.
Vivian reaches the door to her apartment. She turns the knob. It 
opens.
INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY
Vivian's apartment is small and claustrophobic. The walls are a 
dingy faded yellow, and plaster is falling from the ceiling. 
There are a couple of worn-out overstuffed chairs and a bookcase 
piled with everything but books. The majority of the room is 
given over to a large bed that is folded out of a couch. A large 
mangy pile of old blankets and pillows covers it.
As Vivian enters from the hallway she whispers.
VIVIAN
Kit? Kit? You here?
She blinks into the dim room and waits for an answer. There is 
none. It is clear from Vivian's face that she is glad no one is 
home. She closes the door behind herself.
She moves to a small wooden box on the bookshelf and opens it. 
Inside are various drug paraphernalia, but no drugs. She closes 
it, annoyed.
KIT
Viv?
Startled, Vivian spins and sees Kit staring at her from under 
the blankets on the bed. Her face is pale and ghostly. Her voice 
hoarse.
VIVIAN
Jesus, you scared me. I didn't see 
you under there. Why didn't you 
answer me?
99.
KIT
I was waking up. I'm not feeling 
too good.
VIVIAN
You never feel good.
KIT
That's a pretty coat. Did your date 
give you that coat?
VIVIAN
No, it's just rented.
KIT
Those are pretty shoes.
VIVIAN
Yeah. Well, I can't stay very long. 
I got to go back.
KIT
You aren't home yet?
VIVIAN
No, not 'til tomorrow. I just 
wanted some rock. Is there any?
KIT
No. I smoked it all. But we could 
go get some if you have money.
Kit sits up. She wears a sleeveless undershirt that exposes her 
unhealthily thin and pale arms. Vivian stares at her unhappily.
VIVIAN
Fuck, you look like hell. Haven't 
you been eating?
KIT
I didn't have any money.
VIVIAN
You have to work, babe. Besides, 
there's food in the kitchen.
Kit coughs hard.
KIT
I didn't feel like it. I just 
haven't been hungry.
VIVIAN
You have to eat. No wonder you 
don't feel good. God damn it.
Vivian stands restlessly, overcome with both guilt and revulsion.
VIVIAN
You're such a fucking baby.
100.
She pulls off her coat and tosses it onto a chair. She marches 
into the kitchen alcove.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Vivian's kitchen is piled with dirty dishes, old open cans and 
various food boxes. Vivian pours a can of chicken soup into a 
small saucepan on a tiny electric skillet.
KIT (O.S.)
What you doing, Viv?
VIVIAN
I'm making you some soup, damn it. 
You have to eat. You want onions in 
it?
KIT (O.S.)
I'd like that.
Vivian gets a small white onion from the refrigerator and chops 
it with a large butcher knife. She throws the onion into the 
soup.
INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY
Vivian comes out with a bowl of hot soup with a spoon in it. As 
she stands in front of Kit for a moment we almost get the 
impression that she might throw it at her. Instead, she sets it 
down roughly on the bed.
Kit starts to sip the soup. Vivian paces around the room 
restlessly. She moves to the window and opens it.
VIVIAN
God it stinks in here. Why didn't 
you open the window?
KIT
It's cold.
Kit sips the soup.
KIT
This is good. I'm feeling better 
already.
VIVIAN
I'm not your fucking mother.
KIT
I'm sorry. I've just felt lonely. 
You want to go get some rock?
VIVIAN
No, I got to go. I've got a car 
waiting for me. I shouldn't smoke 
it anyway while I'm working.
101.
KIT
You sure look pretty. That guy must 
be treating you real good. Is he 
nice?
VIVIAN
He's alright.
KIT
He must like you a lot to want you 
around for so long. He sure must 
like you.
VIVIAN
Yeah... well, he likes to fuck me.
KIT
He buys you nice things.
VIVIAN
Yeah.
Kit coughs again.
KIT
Maybe you should stay with him, Viv.
VIVIAN
(nervously)
What are you, nuts? The guy's rich. 
Don't you know anything? He can 
have any girl he wants. He has a 
high-class fuck in New York. Rich 
guys don't go for street girls.
KIT
Why'd he pick you up?
VIVIAN
It was a mistake.
(softly)
He was lost. He just wants me 'til 
tomorrow.
KIT
Maybe he'll ask you to stay with 
him.
Vivian doesn't like to think about that. She turns away.
VIVIAN
No.
KIT
Don't worry about me, Viv. I'll be 
okay. I can always get by. You 
should stay with him. You look so 
pretty. I bet if you asked him he'd 
want to keep you.
102.
VIVIAN
God are you stupid. He's just a 
date. That's all.
(beat)
I got to go.
She grabs her coat and puts it on. She walks to the door and 
stands for a moment, uncomfortable, guilty. She pulls some money 
out of her coat pocket.
VIVIAN
Here's twenty. Hell, forty. Don't 
spend it all on rock. Get some food 
tonight, okay? You're gonna get 
sick if you don't keep eating.
(beat)
I... don't know exactly what time 
I'll be back tomorrow, so don't 
wait for me or anything.
She sets two twenty-dollar bills on the bookcase. Kit and Vivian 
stare at each other silently for a moment. In Vivian's hand is 
the rest of her money. She looks down at it.
VIVIAN
Yeah. And... I'm gonna stash some 
of this here. I got it the first 
night with him.
She opens an empty jar of cold cream and stashes most of the 
money inside.
VIVIAN
Don't you touch that money... I'll 
count it when I get back...
Vivian walks to the door and hesitates again. Kit looks at her 
sadly.
KIT
You're not coming back, are you?
Vivian tries to say something but chokes on the words. She takes 
a deep breath.
VIVIAN
I'll be back, babe.
(pause)
You know what? When I get back 
we'll go to Disneyland. Take a bus. 
Would you like that? I'll have lots 
of money.
KIT
That would be fun.
VIVIAN
We'll go on that Space Mountain 
ride. You like that?
103.
KIT
I like Small World with all the 
kids and the little boats.
VIVIAN
We'll go on everything. It'll be 
fun.
Vivian opens the door and slowly steps out.
KIT
I think you should stay with him, 
Viv.
Vivian grits her teeth.
VIVIAN
You're so fucking stupid! Just shut 
up! I'll be back tomorrow.
She exits and closes the door behind herself.
EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Vivian comes quickly out of the apartment building and heads for 
the limo. The Limo Driver opens the door for her.
LIMO DRIVER
I was getting worried.
VIVIAN
I'm fine. Just take me back.
INT. LIMO - DAY
Vivian sits in the back of the limo. She is calmer now. She 
leans back in the seat and wraps the fur tightly around herself.
INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY
Edward and William stand in front of a conference table staring 
at a long flow chart of their acquisition and liquidation of 
Kross Enterprises.
WILLIAM
Well, that's about it. Thirty, 
sixty days. Six months. One year. 
After that, Kross is just naval 
history.
EDWARD
You really think we can scam all 
the pension funds off on P.B.G.?
WILLIAM
Hey, '78 was a great year.
He starts to roll up the charts.
104.
WILLIAM
The only question in my mind is 
what are you going to go after 
next.
EDWARD
(smugly)
North American Steel...
WILLIAM
You're dreaming.
Jake comes into the room.
JAKE
Your helicopter's ready, Mr. 
Harris.
WILLIAM
(glancing sideways Edward)
Helicopter? Going to the opera 
again?
EDWARD
I just want another look at the 
shipyards before I go back to New 
York.
WILLIAM
You're such a sentimental softy.
EDWARD
Why don't you come with me?
WILLIAM
No. I want to finish that chemical 
bid so you can take it back to New 
York.
EDWARD
You can always Fed Ex it later.
WILLIAM
No, you know me. I don't like loose 
ends.
INT. BROKERAGE HALLWAY - DAY
Jake is escorting Edward down the hallway.
JAKE
So, did you learn a lot from Mr. 
Kross?
EDWARD
Who? Oh, no. Not really. We already 
knew it all.
105.
EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY
Edward is sitting comfortably in the helicopter as it passes 
over the decaying shipyards. He stares down at it thoughtfully.
INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Vivian is standing in front of the glass windows, looking out at 
the city, drinking a glass of champagne. The doorbell rings. 
Startled, she spills some champagne on her hand. She turns and 
looks at the door, edgy. It rings again.
Licking the champagne from her hand, she walks across the room 
and up the stairs to the door. She opens it.
William is standing outside with a small briefcase.
WILLIAM
Hello again.
VIVIAN
(nervously)
Hi.
WILLIAM
I take it Edward isn't back from 
his little helicopter trip?
VIVIAN
No.
They wait quietly for a moment, Vivian expecting him to leave 
and William standing firm.
WILLIAM
May I come in?
VIVIAN
Oh, yeah, sure.
William walks past her and down the steps into the living room. 
He spots the open bottle of champagne and walks over to it.
WILLIAM
You like drinking alone?
VIVIAN
Sometimes.
William picks up a glass.
WILLIAM
Do you mind?
Vivian is obviously uncomfortable in his presence, but she 
doesn't feel like she can refuse.
VIVIAN
No.
106.
William sets his briefcase down on the table and pours a full 
glass. He takes a sip.
WILLIAM
It's been a long day.
(pause)
You know Edward's leaving tomorrow, 
don't you?
WILLIAM
Yeah.
William takes another sip. He opens his briefcase and takes out 
a small stack of papers.
WILLIAM
I'm going to leave some papers here 
for him to take back to New York.
He sets the papers down on the table and closes the briefcase. 
He walks over to the window and looks out. He takes another sip.
WILLIAM
Great view. Lord Harris sure knows 
how to live, doesn't he?
VIVIAN
Lord Harris?
WILLIAM
Just a joke. Between me and Ed. 
This must be quite a change for a 
hooker off the boulevard.
Vivian says nothing. William takes a long drink and goes back to 
the bottle for a refill. He stares at Vivian.
WILLIAM
You're a very pretty girl, Vivian. 
Too pretty for the street.
Vivian is silent. William stalks closer to her. He takes a 
drink.
WILLIAM
What do you make a week? Five 
hundred? Even that?
Vivian's tone of voice suddenly becomes hostile.
VIVIAN
What's it to you?
WILLIAM
With the right manager you could 
make a lot of money. More than 
Edward's giving you. Much more than 
you can make on the street.
107.
VIVIAN
I don't like managers. I don't like 
people making money off me.
William smiles.
WILLIAM
You got a mean streak in you. Don't 
you? Maybe that's what Edward liked 
about you.
He takes a sip and turns away.
WILLIAM
There's nothing to get hostile 
about. I have some friends who run 
a nice service. They aren't like 
the pimps you find on the street. 
They don't muscle you. They just 
help you. Sure, they take a cut, 
but since you're making a lot more 
money you won't even think about 
it.
VIVIAN
Yeah, they take their cut. Then they 
sell you their shitty overpriced 
dope. Then they rent you their 
places... they let you use one of 
their cars. Then they tell you they 
need a bigger cut, and the dope costs 
more, too. But don't worry, they'll 
lend you the money 'til your next 
job. Yeah, they'll help you. They'll 
help fuck you. Well, no thanks. I 
only want to get fucked by one person 
at a time.
William's face sours. He downs his champagne quickly and sets 
the glass down on the table. Obviously straining to keep his 
voice calm, he turns to Vivian.
WILLIAM
How long have you been on the 
street, Vivian?
VIVIAN
(quietly)
Six years.
WILLIAM
I read in the paper once that the 
average life expectancy for a 
street hooker was twenty-seven.
VIVIAN
I don't read the paper.
108.
WILLIAM
Don't you like it here? You got 
your champagne, you nice Rodeo 
Drive dresses, your view. Isn't 
this nice?
Vivian says nothing. She turns away from him.
WILLIAM
What are you going to do when 
Edward's finished with you? Go back 
to the street? You're too pretty 
for that. You're just wasting 
yourself. A couple of years fucking 
niggers and drug pushers and your 
face will be ruined.
VIVIAN
Just get out here.
(desperately)
Does Edward want you here? I don't 
think he'd like it if you were 
talking to me like this.
William half laughs.
WILLIAM
Edward? Oh, now I get it. It's 
starting to make sense. You don't 
think Edward's going to get rid of 
you, do you? What do you think? You 
think Edward's going to keep you?
(intensely)
Don't you know what a cold bastard 
he is? He's not going to keep you.
VIVIAN
(yelling)
I know!
WILLIAM
(angrily)
Then what's your problem? I'm 
trying to help you!
Vivian spins and stares at him furiously.
VIVIAN
I don't want your help! I don't 
like you. I'd rather fuck niggers 
and drug pushers than fuck you!
William slaps her hard across the face.
WILLIAM
Don't talk to me like that, whore.
Vivian buckles over, holding her face in pain. William stares at 
her, seething.
109.
WILLIAM
Fine. Go back to the street. End up 
dead in a dumpster. What do I care?
He turns to start to leave, but as he does Vivian leaps at him, 
pounding him from behind.
William turns and slaps her hard again. He slaps her again. 
Vivian keeps punching him.
VIVIAN
You fucker! You fucker!
In the background, Edward opens the door and enters the room. He 
sees the two of them fighting. For a moment he is confused, but 
then he hurries down the steps and runs to them.
EDWARD
Cut it out! What's going on?!
Vivian roughly claws William with her fingernails. Edward pulls 
her away from him.
William, blood dripping from his cheek, lunges at her and slaps 
her again.
Edward punches William hard in the stomach. William buckles over 
in pain.
Edward pulls Vivian further away and lets go of her.
As Edward moves toward William, William straightens with an 
angry look on his face.
WILLIAM
That little bitch!
William is about to rush toward Vivian again when Edward slugs 
him square on the chin. William stops cold and sways in dizzied 
pain.
Edward grabs him by the shoulder and drags him up the steps to 
the front door. William, dazed, doesn't resist.
Edward tosses him out into the hallway. He follows him and 
closes the door.
Vivian stands alone, stunned, holding her face in pain.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Edward roughly throws William up against the wall.
EDWARD
What the fuck are you doing?
William grits his teeth.
110.
WILLIAM
That's some nasty little cunt you 
found.
EDWARD
Yeah, I kind of like her. What the 
fuck were you doing with her?
WILLIAM
I came to drop off some papers and 
she started pissing me off.
EDWARD
What? Did you make a pass at her?
WILLIAM
No.
EDWARD
Well, whatever it was, you look 
pretty stupid.
He takes William by the chin and turns his head so that he can 
see the cuts from Vivian's nails.
WILLIAM
Yeah, I feel pretty stupid. Nice 
right hook you got.
Edward smiles and pats William on the shoulder.
EDWARD
So, what'd you bring me?
WILLIAM
The treatment license bid. Try to 
read it by next week.
EDWARD
I'd invite you in for a drink, but 
I don't think it would be a good 
idea.
WILLIAM
No. That's alright.
(grinning)
I got to go get a tetanus shot.
He wipes the blood from his face with a handkerchief.
WILLIAM
Oh, I need my briefcase, if you 
would be so kind...
Edward opens the doors and goes back into the room.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Edward comes down the steps and crosses to the dining table. He 
grabs William's briefcase.
111.
Vivian is sitting on the couch, unmoving.
Edward walks up the steps and tosses the briefcase out to 
William.
WILLIAM
Have a nice trip tomorrow.
EDWARD
I will.
Edward closes the doors. He turns and looks at Vivian. She seems 
frozen. Edward walks up to the couch and sits next to her.
EDWARD
You alright?
Vivian speaks with an icily calm voice.
VIVIAN
Why do guys always know how to hit 
a girl? Wham, right across the 
cheek. Nice and high so it feels 
like your eye is going to explode. 
Pimps, cops, even little asshole 
lawyers in suits and ties. They all 
hit you the same. What do they do, 
take all the boys aside in high 
school and show them how?
EDWARD
No one's going to hit you anymore.
VIVIAN
Nobody needs to. He already did a 
good enough job.
EDWARD
I'm sorry about that. I don't know 
what got into him.
Vivian slowly stands up.
VIVIAN
I'd better go.
EDWARD
Go? You don't have to go. You 
didn't do anything wrong. I kicked 
Bill out. We've still got one night 
together.
VIVIAN
No. I want to go. I hate it here. I 
want to go home.
Edward stands.
EDWARD
Alright. I understand.
112.
Edward reaches into his jacket and pulls out a long gray 
envelope.
EDWARD
Here. I was going to give you this 
tomorrow, but I'll give it to you 
now. It's three thousand.
He holds it out to her, Vivian doesn't take it.
VIVIAN
You can take out five hundred for 
tonight.
Edward takes her hand and puts the envelope in it. He closes he 
fingers around it.
EDWARD
Don't be silly. Take it all. I may 
be petty about money, but I'm not 
that petty. You earned it.
(beat)
I'm sorry about what happened. I'm 
sorry you won't stay, but I 
understand.
Vivian stares down at the envelope. Her eyes moisten.
VIVIAN
You're the nicest guy I've ever 
known.
EDWARD
Then stay.
VIVIAN
I don't know.
EDWARD
Stay tonight. Not for the money. 
Not because you have to. Stay 
because you want to.
He takes her chin in his hand and kisses her on the lips. As he 
pulls back we can see Vivian debating.
VIVIAN
I don't know. I just... don't think 
so. My face hurts real bad and I 
don't feel so good. It's starting 
to swell up.
EDWARD
We don't have to make love. You can 
just sleep here and have breakfast 
in the morning. Then I'll get you a 
cab before I go to the airport.
VIVIAN
I am kind of tired.
113.
EDWARD
Then stay.
Vivian nods. She carefully sets the envelope down on the coffee 
table.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
In the darkened bedroom Vivian and Edward lie together. Edward 
sleeps deeply, peacefully, with Vivian's back cuddled in close 
to his chest, his arm over her body. Vivian, her face swollen 
and puffy from the blow she received, stares into space, 
sleepless.
She takes Edward's limp hand in her hands and carefully examines 
it. The fingers, the palm, the tiny hairs on the back. She pulls 
it in close to her body and holds it tightly. She kisses the 
fingers. In a low, barely audible voice she says:
VIVIAN
I... love you.
Almost as if she wanted to hear what it sounded like.
Edward stirs a little but continues to sleep. Vivian stares off 
again, her eyes filled with desperate longing. What she has said 
to a sleeping hand she would never dare say to his face. She 
knows only too well that his reply would not be "I love you, 
too". There is nothing she can offer this man. Nothing that 
would hold him. Yet there is an emptiness inside her this night 
that she cannot bear. If she cannot have his lasting love, at 
least she could have a moment of company.
She rolls over and starts to kiss him. Edward stirs.
EDWARD
What? Go back to sleep.
She continues to kiss him, rubbing her hands over his body.
VIVIAN
Make love to me. Make love to me, 
please.
Edward sighs and smiles sleepily. He returns her kisses.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Edward, fully dressed in a suit, is packing his bags. Vivian, 
dressed in her pink outfit, fingers her clothes in the closet. 
She has a nasty blue and purple bruise across her cheek and 
under her eye. It is covered with makeup, but with little 
success.
Edward is the model of a hurried businessman preparing for his 
return trip.
EDWARD
We're running little behind. I have 
to be at L.A.X. in two hours.
114.
He looks over at Vivian, who is staring forlornly at her 
clothes. He tries to understand why she looks so sad.
EDWARD
What's the matter?
VIVIAN
Did... did you want to take these 
back?
EDWARD
Of course not. They're yours. Pack 
them up.
Vivian smiles. Edward turns and closes his suitcase.
EDWARD
All except the fur, of course. 
That's rented.
Vivian pauses. She looks at the beautiful fur coat hanging on 
the rack.
EDWARD
Damn, I forgot all about that 
thing. I've got to send it back 
before I go to the airport. Bring 
it along as we go down.
Vivian pulls the fur from the hanger. From her eyes we can tell 
that it is going to be very difficult for her to part with it.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Edward carries his suitcases out into the living room. He sets 
them down and picks up the phone. He dials the lobby.
EDWARD
Could I have a bellboy come up and 
help me with some bags? Yes. 
Penthouse.
He sets the phone down. Vivian comes into the room, carrying a 
few long thin clothes boxes that she has packed her things into. 
On top of them is the fur.
EDWARD
When the bellboy comes I'll ask him 
to get you a cab, or...
Vivian stands emotionlessly, the boxes held tightly in her arms. 
Edward is debating something.
EDWARD
Oh, what the hell. You want me to 
give you a ride? Would that be 
better than a taxi?
115.
VIVIAN
(quietly)
I don't want to make you late.
EDWARD
I think we have time. I just drop 
the car off at the airport and take 
the plane. The tickets are 
reserved. Yes, let's do it that 
way. I can drop off the fur on the 
way.
The doorbell rings.
EDWARD
Come in!
A bellboy comes in with a small cart. Edward points toward his 
bags and the bellboy goes to pick them up.
As the bellboy loads the things onto the cart, Edward glances 
around the room to see if anything has been left. He notices the 
envelope with the money in it. He picks it up and puts it in his 
jacket.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
As the elevator opens the Bellboy emerges with Edward's and 
Vivian's bags. Edward walks straight to the main desk. Vivian 
stands in the lobby, holding the fur in her arms. She looks 
around the room, taking it all in for one last time.
Edward hands his keys to the Clerk.
EDWARD
Is everything taken care of?
CLERK
Yes sir, I believe so. Let me just 
check the phone bill.
Edward stands impatiently.
Mr. Thomas, on patrol through the lobby, sees Vivian and walks 
to her.
MR. THOMAS
Well, today's the day. I'll miss 
you, Miss Vivian. I hope you had a 
nice stay.
Vivian is nervous and edgy.
VIVIAN
Oh, yes. It was nice.
MR. THOMAS
So you'll be going to New York with 
Mr. Harris?
116.
VIVIAN
No. Back home. Hollywood.
MR. THOMAS
Oh.
He notices the bruise on her face.
MR. THOMAS
(concerned)
Where did you get that bruise?
Vivian touches her face guiltily.
VIVIAN
Oh. I bumped into something. Isn't 
that dumb?
Mr. Thomas sees through this obvious lie. Vivian is shaking 
nervously.
MR. THOMAS
You're trembling. Is there anything 
the matter? Can I help you in any 
way?
Vivian is about to say something when Edward comes up behind 
them.
EDWARD
All set. Let's go.
Mr. Thomas nods slightly to Edward.
MR. THOMAS
Mr. Harris.
EDWARD
Yes. We've got to run. Come on, 
Vivian.
Vivian seems reluctant to leave.
VIVIAN
Could... I get some cigarettes? I 
need one.
Edward looks a trifle annoyed.
EDWARD
We're in a rush.
VIVIAN
They're just over there.
She points to the dry good store.
117.
EDWARD
(sighing)
Alright.
Vivian and Edward head toward the store. Vivian glances back at 
Mr. Thomas, who is still watching her, concerned.
VIVIAN
Bye. Thanks for everything.
INT. DRY GOOD STORE - DAY
Vivian is standing in front of the counter. Edward is gazing at 
a magazine rack.
VIVIAN
Virginia Slim Lights.
The clerk sets the cigarettes down on the counter. Edward 
quickly tosses him a couple dollars.
Edward pulls a woman's magazine from the rack and shows the 
cover to Vivian. On it is a stunningly beautiful young woman.
EDWARD
That's Cindy.
Vivian takes her cigarettes and stares at the cover.
VIVIAN
She's... beautiful.
EDWARD
She's very little. Just over five 
feet. But she's got the best body. 
It's perfect, and her face... you 
can see.
He tosses the magazine back onto the rack and starts to lead her 
out.
EDWARD
Dumber than a doornail, though. I 
guess they beat the intelligence 
out of you in finishing school.
As they exit, Vivian glances back to the smiling face on the 
magazine.
EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL DRIVEWAY - DAY
Edward and Vivian come out of the hotel to their waiting car. 
The bellboy has finished packing the bags in the trunk. Edward 
tips him.
The valets open the doors and Edward and Vivian get in. Edward 
tips the valets. They shut the doors. The Mercedes drives off.
118.
INT. MERCEDES - DAY
As Edward drives the car down Wilshire, Vivian is nervously 
smoking a cigarette. The fur is in her lap and she is 
unconsciously stroking it.
EDWARD
How long do you think it will take 
to get from Beverly Hills to 
Hollywood?
VIVIAN
I don't know for sure. Ten minutes 
or something.
Edward glances at his watch.
EDWARD
And an hour to get to the airport.
(shaking his head)
I don't know why I always cut these 
things so close.
Edward slows the car down as they approach a parking spot in 
front of the furrier. He pulls in and stops the car.
EDWARD
I'll just run in and get rid of 
this.
He reaches over and takes the fur from Vivian. Vivian quickly 
turns her head away. Edward notices.
EDWARD
What's the matter?
VIVIAN
Noth'n.
Edward stares at the back of her head for a moment and then 
decides he doesn't have time to pursue it. He gets out of the 
car.
As she watches Edward take the fur into the store, tears roll 
down Vivian's cheeks. She takes a drag from her cigarette. She 
stashes it out in the car's ashtray.
Within seconds, Edward is back out of the store. He rounds the 
car and jumps in.
EDWARD
Alright. That's done.
Edward puts the car into gear and drives off.
Now Vivian is crying harder. So much that she can't conceal her 
sobs. Edward glances over at her, concerned and annoyed at the 
same time.
119.
EDWARD
Now what? What's the matter?
Vivian is crying hard. She can't talk. Edward continues to drive 
on.
EDWARD
Jesus. What is it? Can you tell me 
why you're upset now? Damn it, I 
don't even know how to get back to 
Hollywood.
VIVIAN
(choking it out)
Just go straight!
EDWARD
What happened to you? Is it the 
fur? You didn't expect me to let 
you keep it, did you? It was 
rented.
VIVIAN
(still crying)
Just forget it!
Vivian tries to control herself. She wipes her eyes and manages 
to stop the tears.
EDWARD
Is that it? The fur?
VIVIAN
Just stop it! Why do you always 
pick at me? I don't want to talk. 
You always make me talk.
EDWARD
I just want to know what's going 
on. If you're unhappy and there is 
something I can do...
VIVIAN
Yes! I loved that fur! Now leave me 
alone.
EDWARD
Vivian. I didn't mean it to end 
like this. I mean, be reasonable. 
That's a twenty thousand dollar 
fur.
VIVIAN
I didn't say I wanted it. I knew 
you were going to take it back. 
Okay? I'm not dumb! I knew I 
couldn't have it. You asked me why 
I was crying and I told you!
Edward is quiet for a moment. Vivian has managed to control her 
crying. She stares coldly ahead.
120.
VIVIAN 
Make a left on Highland. Right 
there.
Edward turns the car and they head up Highland. Edward's face is 
tense.
EDWARD
Look, if you really want a fur, 
I'll buy you a fur. That one was 
just too expensive. Would you like 
a fur?
VIVIAN
No. Just take me home.
EDWARD
I'll get you a fur. I'll miss my 
plane, but if it'll make you stop 
crying I'll buy you something.
VIVIAN
(angrily)
I'm not crying anymore.
EDWARD
God damn it, Vivian. I'll buy you a 
fur. A nice one. Just it can't be 
that one. That one's too much. I'll 
get you the silver mink you tried 
on first. I'll throw away a few 
thousand. Okay? I don't know what 
the fuck you plan to do with one on 
Hollywood Boulevard, but...
VIVIAN
LEAVE ME ALONE! I DON'T WANT 
ANYTHING FROM YOU!
Edward slams on the brakes. The car stops hard. Vivian stares at 
him defiantly.
VIVIAN 
You want me to walk home!? I'll 
walk home! It's three miles but 
I'll walk!
EDWARD
I don't want you to walk! I want 
you to stop yelling!
Vivian turns from him and stares out her window. Edward takes a 
deep breath and starts the car up again.
Vivian stares out the window. They are leaving the nice, well-
tended homes of Hancock Park and are approaching the streets of 
Hollywood.
They are both tensely silent as Edward drives on. Vivian begins 
to cry softly.
121.
Edward listens to her with annoyance, but resists the impulse to 
say anything.
They approach Hollywood Blvd. and Edward makes a right.
As Vivian stares out the window of the Mercedes she sees the 
grimy streets and the shabby people mixing with the occasional 
tourists. As they continue down the street toward Vivian's 
section of the Boulevard we will see less and less tourists and 
even shabbier-looking people. The streets become more grim and 
dirty.
Vivian is sobbing harder now, trying to control herself but 
unable. Edward, getting madder as it grows louder, finally 
bursts.
EDWARD 
I don't know why you had to do this 
to me. We had a wonderful time 
together and now you have to ruin 
it.
Vivian grits her teeth and tries not to say anything. Edward, 
now that he's gotten it out of his system, adopts a slightly 
gentler tone as he continues to lecture her.
EDWARD
You should have told me you like 
the fur so much. I could have 
gotten you something yesterday. 
It's really a stupid thing to cry 
about. You know I bent over 
backwards to make things pleasant 
for you and it's just a shame that 
you're going to spoil it all by 
being unreasonable.
The streets they pass are now filled mostly with drug dealers, 
an occasional prostitute, and various homeless tramps. Vivian 
stares out the window at the destitution outside, her eyes fixed 
and red. She is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
EDWARD
This is about the area. Do you want 
me to leave you her, or do you have 
a place nearby?
Vivian says nothing.
EDWARD
Vivian? Where do you want me to let 
you off?
Vivian screams hysterically. She seems to have suddenly gone 
crazy. She starts pounding the roof of the car with her fists.
Edward quickly pulls the car over to the curb and stops it. 
Vivian is still screaming and pounding.
EDWARD
VIVIAN! VIVIAN, CUT IT OUT!
122.
Edward grabs her by the wrists and tries to stop her from 
pounding the ceiling. Instead she starts pounding him.
EDWARD
Get out! GET OUT OF THE CAR!
Vivian continues to pound him for a moment, but then she breaks 
down and starts to sob limply.
EDWARD
You're out of your mind. You're 
insane!
Vivian is crying.
EDWARD
I've had enough of this. Get out of 
the car.
Vivian doesn't move.
EDWARD
Get out of the car!
When she still doesn't move, Edward throws open his door and 
gets out.
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD - CONTINUOUS
Edward walks around the car and opens the trunk. He pulls out 
Vivian's few boxes of clothes and sets them down on the curb. He 
shuts the trunk.
He walks over to the passenger door and opens it.
EDWARD
(firmly)
Get out.
Vivian doesn't move. She is still crying.
EDWARD
Don't make me regret ever picking 
you up. Now please, get out of the 
car. I have to go.
Edward grabs her by the hand and starts to pull her from the 
car. Vivian explodes again and starts hitting and kicking him.
Edward forcibly drags her from the car and then throws her to 
the ground. He slams the door shut.
As Vivian hits the ground she begins to cry again, too weak to 
fight anymore.
Edward looks down at her. He takes the money envelope from his 
jacket and holds it out to her.
123.
EDWARD
Here, take it. It's your money.
VIVIAN
(sobbing in fits)
I don't want it. Just go away.
EDWARD
Take it.
VIVIAN
No.
EDWARD
You'll regret it tomorrow if you 
don't take it. You'll regret it the 
minute I drive away.
Vivian doesn't say anything. Edward lays the envelope down on 
the sidewalk in front of her.
He turns and walks around the car. Vivian lies frozen for a 
moment and then suddenly snaps alive as she hears the sound of 
his car door opening and closing.
She grabs the envelope and crushes it in her hand. She leaps at 
the car and starts smashing her fists against it and the 
windows.
VIVIAN
Go to hell! I hate you! I hate your 
money! I hate it!
We see a flash of Edward's face as he stares at Vivian pounding 
on his window. She's completely lost her mind. He puts the car 
in gear and pushes on the accelerator.
Vivian is still pounding as the car pulls away. In a final 
gesture of rage she throws the envelope at the car and it breaks 
open as the car peels off.
The money scatters across the gutter as the car drives away. 
Vivian falls to her knees, weak and crying.
Across the street various shabby-looking people stare at Vivian 
and the money.
Vivian is on her hands and knees sobbing. She can barely 
breathe. She is completely broken.
She wipes the tears from her cheeks. She looks down the street. 
The Mercedes is gone.
For a brief moment she is still, frozen like a statue.
She reaches down in the gutter and starts to pick up the money.
DISSOLVE TO:
124.
EXT. BUS - DAY
An old Greyhound bus drives down the freeway from Los Angeles. 
It moves easily through the traffic. A small sign over the 
windshield reads: DISNEYLAND.
INT. BUS - DAY
Vivian and Kit are sitting in the bus. Kit is sitting next to 
the window, looking outside with a warm, happy smile. She is so 
excited she can barely stand it.
KIT
Could I get one of those balloons? 
You know, with the ears?
Vivian sits next to Kit staring off with utterly blank and empty 
eyes. The side of her cheek is still bruised. She is wearing her 
mint green dress, but her hair is poorly done and lies limply 
around her pale face. Kit coughs.
KIT
Oh, I guess that's stupid. Those 
are for kids.
Vivian blinks and glances over at Kit, tired.
VIVIAN
No, babe. You can have a balloon. 
One with the ears.
Kit smiles happily and looks back out the window. Vivian stares 
emptily ahead.
FADE OUT:
125.
